    value: >-
      <p>Once per battle, the commander may order the army to rage. Increase the
      army’s OM by 2, decrease its DV by 1, and add a +1 bonus on its Morale
      checks against fear and routing. While this is in effect, the army can’t
      use the tactics cautious combat, defensive wall, expert flankers, hold the
      line, sniper support, or withdraw; nor can it use the defensive or
      cautious strategies. If using such a tactic or strategy, you immediately
      switch to the standard tactic or strategy.</p>
