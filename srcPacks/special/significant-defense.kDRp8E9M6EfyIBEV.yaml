    value: >-
      <p>The army has a significant defense such as powerful damage reduction or
      numerous immunities and/or resistances. Increase its DV by 10, but only
      against armies that can’t overcome those defenses. In some cases, the GM
      might rule that an army is simply undefeatable by an enemy army because of
      its defenses (though the GM should never pit the PCs against such an army
      unless the PCs initiate a foolish battle).</p>
