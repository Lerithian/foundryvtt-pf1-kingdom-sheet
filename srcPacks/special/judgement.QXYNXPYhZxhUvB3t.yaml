      <p>Once each Ranged or Melee phase, the army may choose to increase its
      damage by 1, increase its DV by 1, heal a number of hit points equal to
      half its ACR, or treat its attacks as magic weapons. This ability is
      suspended for any phase in which the army is unable to attack because of
      fear, and ends immediately if the army routs.</p>
