    value: >-
      <p>The army ignores the Defense of fortifications. It automatically
      succeeds at checks to withdraw. Ethereal travel and similar effects also
      grant this ability. An army with teleportation can travel to any hex on
      the same day (its speed is irrelevant and not hampered by difficult
      terrain).</p>
