      <p>In the Melee phase, the army deals +1d4 points of damage against an
      undead target army. Instead of dealing extra damage to an enemy army, the
      army can use this ability to heal itself; if it takes an OM penalty equal
      to half its ACR for one Ranged or Melee phase, it heals a number of hit
      points equal to its ACR.</p>
