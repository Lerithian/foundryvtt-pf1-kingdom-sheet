      <p>If an army’s units can use magic (from either spell-like abilities or
      actual spellcasting), increase its OM and DV by the spell level of the
      highest-level spell the individual unit can cast. If any of the army’s
      offensive spells has a range greater than touch, the army can make ranged
      attacks.</p>
