      <p>The army regains a number of hit points equal to half its regeneration
      value each Ranged or Melee phase. When an army with regeneration is
      reduced to 0 hp, it is defeated only if at least one enemy army survives
      at the end of that phase to finish off the regenerating creatures. Outside
      of battle, the army regains a number of hit points equal to half its
      regeneration value each hour.</p>
