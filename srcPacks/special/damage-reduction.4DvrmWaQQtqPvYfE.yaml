      <p>Increase its DV by 10, but only against armies that can’t overcome
      those defenses. In some cases, the GM might rule that an army is simply
      undefeatable by an enemy army because of its defenses (though the GM
      should never pit the PCs against such an army unless the PCs initiate a
      foolish battle).</p>
