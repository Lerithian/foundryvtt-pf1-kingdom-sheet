      <p>In the Melee phase, the army deals +1d4 points of damage against a
      living target army. If the army with this ability is undead, instead of
      dealing extra damage to an enemy army, it can use this ability to heal
      itself; if it takes an OM penalty equal to half its ACR for one Ranged or
      Melee phase, it heals a number of hit points equal to its ACR.</p>
