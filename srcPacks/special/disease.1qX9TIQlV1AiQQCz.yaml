      <p>If the army damages an enemy, the enemy becomes diseased and takes a
      cumulative â€“1 penalty to its OM and DV each day after the battle. Curing
      the disease requires a successful Stability check modified by this
      penalty, and allows the army to reduce this penalty by 1 each day
      thereafter until the penalty is gone.</p>
