      <p>If the army damages an enemy army that contains animals (including
      animal mounts), that army must attempt a Morale check (DC = 10 + your
      army’s ACR). Failure means the enemy army is afraid and can’t attempt an
      Offense check to attack during the next phase. If an army fails a Morale
      check during a phase in which it is already afraid, it routs.</p>
