    value: >-
      <p>The army has a significant defense from resistances. Increase its DV by
      10, but only against armies that can’t overcome those defenses. In some
      cases, the GM might rule that an army is simply undefeatable by an enemy
      army because of its defenses (though the GM should never pit the PCs
      against such an army unless the PCs initiate a foolish battle).</p>
