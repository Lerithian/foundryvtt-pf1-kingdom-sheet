      <p>If the army damages an enemy army, that army must attempt a Morale
      check (DC = 10 + your army’s ACR). Failure means the enemy army is afraid
      and can’t attempt an Offense check to attack during the next phase. If an
      army fails a Morale check during a phase in which it is already afraid, it
      routs.</p>
