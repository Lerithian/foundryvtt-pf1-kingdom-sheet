      <p>The commander makes the army trap game, hunt, and fish to augment its
      food supplies. Reduce the armyâ€™s Consumption and speed by half for any
      week this boon is used. The GM may rule that Huge and larger armies
      deplete the available resources from a hex over 1d3 weeks, requiring the
      army to move if it wants to maintain the reduced Consumption level.</p>
