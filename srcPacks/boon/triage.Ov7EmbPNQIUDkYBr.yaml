      <p>Whether using magic, alchemy, herbalism, or folk knowledge, the
      commander drills the army in using emergency methods to treat wounds. Once
      per battle, the army may take a â€“4 penalty on its Offense check during the
      Ranged or Melee phase and heal damage equal to half its ACR. If the army
      has the healing potions resource, it also gains the healing from this boon
      (without the Offense check penalty) when it uses healing potions.</p>
