      <p>A religious cult of an alignment opposed to the kingdomâ€™s alignment
      begins kidnapping, converting, or even publicly sacrificing citizens.
      </p><hr /><p>Attempt a Loyalty check and a Stability check. If both
      succeed, the cult is disbanded before your kingdom takes any penalties
      from the event. For each of these checks you fail, Unrest increases by 1
      and Productivity, Society, and Stability decrease by 1. If both checks
      fail, the event continues in the next Event phase.</p>
