      <p>The citizens demand a particular terrain improvement be built (01–75)
      or demolished (76–100).</p><hr /><p>Select the building type randomly from
      those available for the settlement. If the demand is not met by the next
      Event phase, Unrest increases by 1. Alternatively, you can suppress the
      citizens’ demands and negate the event by succeeding at a Loyalty check,
      but this reduces Loyalty by 2 and increases Unrest by 1.</p>
