      <p>A fire, a flood, a storm, an earthquake, massive sabotage, or another
      disaster strikes the settlement! </p><hr /><p>Roll 1d6 to determine how
      many lots are threatened by the disaster. On a result of 6, the disaster
      is widespread and affects 1d6 additional adjacent lots. Attempt a
      Stability check for each threatened lot; failure means the disaster
      destroys the building in that lot and Unrest increases by 1. (This
      Stability check represents your kingdom’s ability to prepare for or react
      to the disaster as well as the structure’s ability to withstand
      damage.)</p>
