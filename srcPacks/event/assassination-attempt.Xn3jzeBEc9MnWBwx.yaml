    value: >-
      <p>One of your leaders (determined randomly) is the target of an
      assassination attempt. </p><hr /><p>If the target is a PC, the GM should
      run the attempt as an encounter, using an assassin of a CR equal to the
      targeted PCâ€™s level. If the target is an NPC, you must succeed at a
      Stability check to prevent the assassination. If the assassination occurs,
      Unrest increases by 1d6 and the kingdom immediately incurs the penalties
      for not having a leader in that role.</p>
