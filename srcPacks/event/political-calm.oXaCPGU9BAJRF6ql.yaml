      <p>A sudden absence of political machinations coincides with an increase
      in public approval. </p><hr /><p>Unrest decreases by 1d6. Until the next
      Event phase, you gain a +2 bonus on checks to resolve continuous events.
      If your kingdom has no Unrest and no continuous events, both Loyalty and
      Stability increase by 1. If you are using Law settlement modifiers for the
      kingdom (see Expanding Settlement Modifiers), this also increases Law by 1
      for the entire kingdom.</p>
