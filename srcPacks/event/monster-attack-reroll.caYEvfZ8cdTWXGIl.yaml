    value: >-
      <p>A monster (or group of monsters) attacks the kingdom. </p><hr /><p>The
      GM picks a claimed hex in the kingdom in which the monster is active. The
      CR of the monster encounter is equal to the party’s APL + 1d4 – 1. You can
      personally deal with the monster (earning XP and treasure normally for
      your efforts) or succeed at a Stability check to eliminate it (which
      doesn’t affect you or the kingdom’s statistics). If the monster is not
      defeated this turn, Unrest increases by 4. If the kingdom’s Unrest is 5 or
      higher, the monster’s hex becomes unclaimed—this is in addition to losing
      control of hexes in the Upkeep phase because of the kingdom’s high Unrest
      score.</p>
