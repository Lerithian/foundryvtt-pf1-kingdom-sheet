  description:
    value: >-
      <p>An empty settlement lot is taken over by beggars, troublemakers, and
      people unable to find adequate work or housing; they camp there with
      tents, wagons, and shanties. You cannot use the lot for anything until the
      squatters are dispersed. </p><hr /><p>Fame and Stability decrease by 1,
      and Unrest increases by 2. You may try to disperse the squatters with a
      Stability check. Success means the squatters are dispersed and the event
      is not continuous, but if a House or Tenement is not built in that lot on
      the next turn, Infamy increases by 1 and Unrest by 2. Failing the
      Stability check means the event is continuous, and you may not build on
      that lot until the event is resolved.</p>
