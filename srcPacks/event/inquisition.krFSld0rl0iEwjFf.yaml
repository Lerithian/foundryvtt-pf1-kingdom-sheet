      <p>Zealots mobilize public opinion against a particular race, religion,
      kingdom, behavior, or kingdom leader.</p><hr /><p>Attempt a Loyalty check.
      If you fail, the zealots run rampant; Infamy and Law increase by 1 and
      Lore, Loyalty, Productivity, and Stability decrease by 2. If you succeed,
      the zealots are somewhat suppressed; Lore, Loyalty, Productivity, and
      Stability decrease by 1. Two successful checks in a row end the event (if
      a check ends the event, no penalties from it occur that turn).</p>
