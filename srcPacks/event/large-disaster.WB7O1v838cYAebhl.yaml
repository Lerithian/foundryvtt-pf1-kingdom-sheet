    value: >-
      <p>A fire, storm, earthquake, flood, massive sabotage, or other disaster
      strikes! </p><hr /><p>Roll 1d6; on a result of 1–5, the disaster threatens
      only 1 improved hex. On a result of 6, the disaster is widespread and
      threatens 1d6 additional improved hexes adjacent to the target hex.
      Attempt a Stability check for each threatened hex; failure means the
      disaster destroys one terrain improvement in the hex and Unrest increases
      by 1. (This Stability check represents your kingdom’s ability to prepare
      for or react to the disaster as well as the structure’s ability to
      withstand damage.)</p>
