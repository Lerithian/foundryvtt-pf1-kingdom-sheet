      <p>Pests, blight, and weather ruin the harvest in the settlementâ€™s hex and
      all adjacent hexes. </p><hr /><p>Attempt two Stability checks. If both
      succeed, the problem is fixed before your kingdom takes any penalties from
      the event. If only one succeeds, affected farms reduce Consumption by 1
      (instead of the normal reduction) in the next Upkeep phase. If neither
      succeeds, affected farms do not reduce Consumption at all in the next
      Upkeep phase.</p>
