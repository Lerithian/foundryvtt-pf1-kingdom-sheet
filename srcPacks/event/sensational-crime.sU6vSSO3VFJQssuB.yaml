      <p>A serial killer, arsonist, or daring bandit plagues your kingdom.
      </p><hr /><p>Attempt two Stability checks, adding the settlementâ€™s Law and
      subtracting its Crime. If you succeed at both checks, the criminal is
      caught before your kingdom takes any penalties from the event. If you fail
      at one, the criminal escapes, Unrest increases by 1, and the event is
      continuous. If you fail at both, the criminal makes a fool of the
      authorities; Law and Loyalty decrease by 1, Treasury decreases by 1d4 BP,
      Unrest increases by 2, and the event is continuous.</p>
