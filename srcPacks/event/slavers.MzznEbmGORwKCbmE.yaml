    value: >-
      <p>Criminals begin kidnapping citizens and selling them into slavery.
      </p><hr /><p>Attempt a Loyalty check and a Stability check, each with a
      penalty equal to the number of Brothels, Tenements, Waterfronts, and lots
      with squatters in the settlement. If you succeed at both checks, the
      slavers are caught before your kingdom takes any penalties from the event.
      If you fail at one of the checks, Loyalty, Stability, and Unrest decrease
      by 1, but the event is not continuous. If you fail at both checks,
      Loyalty, Stability, and Unrest decrease by 2, and the event is
      continuous.</p>
