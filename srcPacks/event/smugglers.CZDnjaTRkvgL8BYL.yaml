      <p>Unscrupulous merchants are subverting legitimate businesses. </p><hr
      /><p>Attempt a Loyalty check and a Stability check, each with a penalty
      equal to the number of Piers, Waterfronts, and trade routes in the
      kingdom. If you succeed at both checks, the smugglers are stopped before
      your kingdom takes any penalties from the event. If you fail at one of the
      checks, Corruption increases by 1d2 in each settlement, Crime increases by
      1 for the kingdom, Productivity for the kingdom decreases by 1d3, Treasury
      decreases by 1d3 BP, and the event is not continuous. If you fail at both
      of the checks, Corruption increases by 1d4, Crime for the kingdom
      increases by 1, Productivity for the kingdom decreases by 1d6, Treasury
      decreases by 1d6 BP, and the event is continuous.</p>
