      <p>Thugs and dissidents riot and destroy property. </p><hr /><p>Attempt a
      Loyalty check and a Stability check. If you succeed at both, the vandals
      are stopped before your kingdom takes any penalties. If you fail at one
      check, Society decreases by 1 and one random building in the settlement is
      damaged. If you fail at both, one random building is destroyed (Unrest
      increases by 1 for each lot of the destroyed building), and 1d3 other
      random buildings are damaged. A damaged building provides no benefits
      until half its cost is spent repairing it.</p>
