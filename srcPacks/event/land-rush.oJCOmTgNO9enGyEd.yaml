      <p>Overeager settlers claim an unclaimed hex and construct a Farm, Mine,
      Quarry, or Sawmill at their own expense, but are fighting over ownership.
      This hex is not part of your kingdom, so you gain no benefits from it.
      </p><hr /><p>Productivity, Society, and Stability decrease by 1. Attempt a
      Loyalty check. If you succeed, Unrest increases by 1. If you fail, Unrest
      increases by 1d4. If you construct an identical improvement in an adjacent
      hex during your next Edict phase, remove this eventâ€™s changes to
      Productivity, Society, and Stability.</p>
