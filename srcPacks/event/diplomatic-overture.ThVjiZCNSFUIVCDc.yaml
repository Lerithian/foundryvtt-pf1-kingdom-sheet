      <p>A nearby kingdom sends an ambassador to you to negotiate an embassy
      (01–60), treaty (61–90), or alliance (91–100), as if using a diplomatic
      edict.</p><hr /><p> If the GM doesn’t have an appropriate kingdom in mind
      when this event occurs, determine the kingdom’s alignment randomly; it may
      be hostile or friendly. The ambassador bears 1d4 BP worth of gifts for
      your kingdom.</p>
