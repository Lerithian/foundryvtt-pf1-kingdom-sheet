      <p>One of your Houses or Tenements becomes a hive of illicit drug trade.
      </p><hr /><p>Attempt a Loyalty check and a Stability check, with a penalty
      equal to the number of Brothels, Tenements, Waterfronts, and lots with
      squatters in the settlement. If you succeed at both checks, you eliminate
      the drug den before your kingdom takes any penalties from the event. If
      you fail at one check, Crime and Unrest increase by 1. If you fail at both
      checks, Crime and Unrest increase by 1; Economy, Loyalty, and Stability
      decrease by 1; and on the next Event phase, a second drug den event occurs
      in the same settlement (01– 50) or the nearest settlement (51–100).</p>
