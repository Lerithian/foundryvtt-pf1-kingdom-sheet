      <p>A Ruin is a partially destroyed building. </p><hr /><p>If you claim a
      hex containing a Ruin and build a settlement at the Ruinâ€™s location, you
      can use the Ruin as the basis of an appropriate type of building (as
      determined by the GM), reducing the cost of that building by half.
      Alternatively, you can salvage building materials from the Ruin, reducing
      the cost of 1 building in that hex by 1d4 BP.</p>
