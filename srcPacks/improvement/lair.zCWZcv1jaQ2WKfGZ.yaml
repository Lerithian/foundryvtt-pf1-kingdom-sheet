      <p>A Lair is usually a cave or defensible shelter that can be used as a
      defensive fallback point, a storage location, or even a guardpost or
      prison. </p><hr /><p>If you claim a hex with a Lair, Stability increases
      by 1. If you construct a Fort or Watchtower over a Lair, its Defense
      increases by 1. At the GM’s option, a Lair may allow access to an
      underground cavern hex (see Table 4–6: Terrain and Terrain
      Improvements).</p>
