    value: >-
      <p>An Aqueduct brings water from alpine lakes and rivers to lowland cities
      where water is scarce or insufficient for the local populace. A finished
      series of Aqueduct hexes must connect to a hill or mountain hex (with a
      river or lake) on one end and a settlement on the other end; otherwise,
      you do not gain its benefit.</p><hr /><p><strong>Terrain</strong>: One end
      must be hill or mountain hex; can pass through any type of
      hex.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: Loyalty +1, Stability +1, allows
      settlement to build water-dependent
      buildings.</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: As a Road, except the cost is not
      doubled for hexes with rivers (see Table 4â€“6: Terrain and Terrain
      Improvements).</p>
