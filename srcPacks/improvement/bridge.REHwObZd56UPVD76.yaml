      <p>A Bridge allows your Road hexes to cross rivers.</p><hr
      /><p><strong>Cost</strong>: When you build a Road in a hex that contains a
      river, the doubled coast of the Road includes the cost of bridges needed
      to cross the river. You don’t need to build a Bridge as a separate unit;
      it’s listed here for reference only.</p>
