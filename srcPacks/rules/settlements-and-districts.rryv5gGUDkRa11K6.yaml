        <p>The greatest assets of your kingdom are its settlements. Most
        settlements start as simple villages, and some grow over time into
        bustling cities.</p><p>You can use the District Grid to create the
        initial design for your settlement and decide where to place additional
        buildings as it grows.</p><p>The District Grid is divided into 9 large
        blocks separated by streets. Each block consists of 4 smaller lots
        separated by alleys. Treat each lot as approximately 750 feet per side,
        so overall the district takes up about 1 square mile. On each lot you
        may construct a building, and each building affects your kingdom's
        Economy, Loyalty, and so on. Descriptions of these buildings, as well as
        the bonuses they provide once they're added to a settlement, are in the
        'Building Types' section.</p><p>Most settlements only have 1 district.
        If your District Grid is full and you want to add another district (for
        example, if you run out of available lots in that settlement and want to
        construct additional buildings), you can create an additional district
        for that settlement by paying the preparation cost for the settlement's
        terrain as listed on Terrain and Terrain Costs (see below). Remember
        that your kingdom's Control DC is based on the number of districts in
        your settlement.</p><p>Icons representing each of the building types are
        included as tokens. You can attach them to your District Grid as your
        settlement grows.</p><p>The placement of buildings in your district is
        up to you - you can start in the center of the district and build
        outward, or start at the edge and build toward the center. Some
        buildings (such as the Guildhall) take up more than 1 lot on the grid.
        You can't divide up these larger structures, though you can place them
        so they cover a street. (Streets do not count as
        lots.)</p><p><strong>Construction</strong>: Construction is completed in
        the same turn you spend BP for the building, no matter what its size is.
        A building's benefits apply to your kingdom immediately. At the GM's
        discretion, construction magic (such as lyre of building, fabricate, or
        wall of stone) can reduce a single building's BP cost by 2 (minimum 0).
        This is a one-time reduction per turn, regardless of the amount of magic
        used.</p><p><strong>Population</strong>: A settlement's population is
        approximately equal to the number of completed lots within its districts
        Ã— 250. A grid that has all 36 lots filled with buildings has a
        population of approximately 9,000.</p><p><strong>Base Value</strong>:
        The base value of a settlement is used to determine what magic items may
        easily be purchased there. There is a 75% chance that any item of that
        value or lower can be found for sale in the settlement with little
        effort. The base value of a new settlement is 0 gp. Certain buildings
        (such as a Market or Tavern) increase a settlement's base value. A
        settlement's base value can never increase above the values listed below
        in Table: Settlement Size and Base Value (except under special
        circumstances decided by the GM).</p><p><strong>Defense </strong>: A
        settlement's Defense is used with the mass combat rules. It otherwise
        has no effect unless the settlement is attacked. You can increase a
        settlement's Defense by building certain structures (such as City
        Walls).</p><p>@Compendium[pf1-kingdom-sheet.scenes.qYQrLDT1grPCWKqv]{District

        <p>Before you can start your own kingdom, you first need a base of
        operations - a fort, village, or other settlement - where you can rest
        between adventures and where your citizens know they can find you if
        they need help or want to pay their taxes. Once you have a kingdom,
        you'll want to create more settlements in order for the kingdom to grow
        and prosper. To found a settlement, you must perform the following
        steps. (These steps assume you're building a new settlement from
        scratch; if you're attempting to incorporate an existing settlement into
        your kingdom, see Free City Terrain Improvement.)</p><p><strong>Step 1 -
        Acquire funds. </strong>You'll need money and resources in the form of
        build points.</p><p><strong>Step 2 - Explore and clear a hex </strong>.
        You'll need to explore the hex where you want to put the settlement. See
        the Exploration Time column on Terrain and Terrain Costs (see below) to
        see how long this takes. Once you have explored the hex, clear it of
        monsters and dangerous hazards. The time needed to clear it depends on
        the nature of the threats; this step is usually handled by you
        completing adventures there to kill or drive out
        monsters.</p><p><strong>Step 3 - Claim the hex as yours. </strong>Once
        you have BP and have explored and cleared the hex, you can claim it.
        Spend 1 BP to do so; this represents setting up very basic
        infrastructure such as clearing paths, hiring patrols, setting up a tent
        city, and so on. This establishes the hex as part of your kingdom (or
        the beginning of your kingdom).</p><p><strong>Step 4 - Prepare the site
        for construction </strong>. To put a settlement on a claimed hex, you'll
        need to prepare it. Depending on the site, this process may involve
        clearing trees, moving boulders, digging sanitation trenches, and so on.
        See the Preparation Cost column on Terrain and Terrain Costs (see below)
        for the BP cost. If your settlement is in a hex containing a canal,
        lake, ocean, river, or similar large body of water, you must decide
        which of your settlement's borders are water (riverbanks, lakeshores, or
        seashores) or land. Some types of buildings, such as Mills, Piers, and
        Waterfronts, must be adjacent to water.</p><p>A new settlement consists
        of 1 district, represented by the District Grid map. Mark the four
        borders on the District Grid as land or water, as
        appropriate.</p><p><strong>Step 5 - Construct your first buildings
        </strong>. Construct 1 building in your settlement and pay its BP cost.
        If this is your kingdom's first settlement, you should start with an
        Inn, Shrine, Monastery, or Watchtower. In addition, you may also
        purchase and construct 1 House, Mansion, Noble Villa, or Tenement. If
        your first building is an Inn, you must construct a House or Tenement
        next to it, as building an Inn requires an adjacent House or
        Tenement.</p><p>When you complete these steps, you've founded your
        settlement! If this is your first settlement, it's considered your
        kingdom's capital city.</p><h1>Capital City</h1><p>A kingdom should have
        a capital city - the seat of your power. Your first settlement is your
        capital. If you want to designate a different settlement as the capital,
        you may do so in Step 6 of the Edict phase. Your capital city primarily
        comes into play if your kingdom loses hexes. If you change the capital
        city, attempt a Stability check. Success means Unrest increases by 1;
        failure means Unrest increases by 1d6.</p>

        <p>In addition to the commonly available items in a settlement as
        determined by its base value, some buildings increase the likelihood of
        having specific or unusual magic items available for
        purchase.</p><p><strong>Gaining Item Slots: </strong>When you construct
        one of these buildings, mark the appropriate boxes in the Magic Items
        section of the settlement's District Grid; this indicates that the
        settlement has gained a slot for an item of that
        type.</p><p><strong>Filling Item Slots </strong>: In Step 3 of the
        Upkeep phase, you roll to fill vacant magic item slots in each district.
        Roll d% once for each district that has an open magic item slot (if the
        district has more than one, select one randomly). There is a 50% chance
        (51-100) that an appropriate magic item becomes available in that slot.
        This item's price cannot exceed the base value for the settlement
        (reroll if the item's price exceeds the settlement's base
        value).</p><p><strong>Example: </strong><em>Jessica's settlement has a
        base value of 200 gp. She built an Herbalist last turn, giving the
        settlement 1 minor potion slot. In the Upkeep phase this turn, she rolls
        d% and gets a result of 62, meaning she can roll a random minor potion
        to fill the settlement's empty slot. She rolls on Table 15-12: Potions (
        Core Rulebook </em>478) and gets a result of 45, indicating a potion of
        a 1st-level spell. If she had rolled anything more valuable than the 200
        gp base value for her settlement, she would have to reroll until she got
        an acceptable result. Once a magic item is rolled for a settlement in
        this way, it remains on the market until someone purchases
        it.</p><p><em>Pathfinder RPG Ultimate Equipment </em>includes extensive
        random magic item tables for specific slots and price increments. These
        tables may be more convenient than using the magic item tables in the
        Core Rulebook.</p><p><strong>Emptying Item Slots: </strong>If you are
        unsatisfied with a magic item generated by a settlement, there are three
        ways to purge an undesirable item and make its slot vacant.</p><p>The
        first is to purchase it with your own gp, which makes it your personal
        property and means you may do with it what you please (use it, sell it
        at half price for gold, deposit it in the kingdom's Treasury during the
        next Income phase, use it as a reward for a local general, and so
        on).</p><p>The second method is to manipulate your kingdom's economy to
        encourage an NPC to purchase the item (such as a random adventurer
        passing through the settlement). During Step 3 of the Income phase, you
        may attempt one Economy check for each filled slot you want to empty.
        For every such check after the first one in a turn, your Economy
        decreases by 1, since these manipulations are harmful to your kingdom's
        economy and typically only serve to get rid of an item you consider
        undesirable. If the check fails, nothing happens. If the check succeeds,
        erase the item from that slot; you may attempt to fill the empty slot as
        normal in the next Upkeep phase. You do not gain any gp or BP from this
        sale; the money goes to the building's owner, who uses it to acquire or
        craft the next item.</p><p>The third way is to spend BP (1 BP = 2,000
        gp) to purchase the item. If you take the item for your own use, this
        counts as withdrawing BP from the Treasury for your personal use (see
        Step 1 of the Income Phase - Make Withdrawals from the Treasury). If you
        use the item in a way that doesn't directly benefit you or the other PCs
        (such as giving it to a hero of your army or donating it to a settlement
        as a religious or historical artifact), then purchasing it is
        essentially like other kingdom expenditures and does not increase Unrest
        or decrease Loyalty</p>

        <p>You improve settlements by constructing buildings, which provide
        bonuses to the kingdom in general and the settlement in particular. Some
        buildings also intersect with the mass combat rules, notably with
        fortifications and reserve armies.</p><p><strong>Demolition</strong>: If
        a lot has a building, you can clear it for new construction. Doing so
        costs 1 BP. You may construct a building on a lot the same turn you
        demolish the old building there. You do not regain BP for a demolished
        building (but see Rebuilding, below).</p><p><strong>Destroyed
        Lots</strong>: If an event or a pillaging army destroys 1 or more lots,
        the devastation causes Unrest to increase by 1 per lot
        destroyed.</p><p><strong>Rebuilding</strong>: If you rebuild the same
        type of building on a destroyed lot, the cost is halved, as you can
        reuse some of the materials for the same purpose. If you rebuild a
        different type of building on that lot, reduce the cost of the new
        building by 1/4 the cost of the old building (minimum 1 BP). If you
        build smaller buildings on top of a site that held a multi-lot building,
        split the discount evenly over the new buildings. For example, if you
        demolish an Academy and construct a Mansion and a Luxury Store on top of
        those lots, each building gets a 6 BP discount (1/4 of 52 BP is 13,
        divided evenly between the two).</p>

        <h1>Building Descriptions</h1> <p>Buildings are described in the
        following format.</p><p><strong>Building Name</strong>: The type of
        buildings contained in this lot. In most cases, each lot represents
        numerous buildings of that type, rather than a single
        edifice.</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: The cost in BP to construct the
        building.</p><p><strong>Lots</strong>: How many lots the building
        fills.</p><p><strong>Kingdom</strong>: Building modifiers to Economy,
        Loyalty, and Stability stack, affect your entire kingdom, and are
        ongoing from turn to turn. Modifiers to Unrest occur once when the
        building is completed. This category also lists any bonuses to Fame from
        having the building.</p><p><strong>Discount</strong>: Some buildings
        halve the cost of constructing a related type of building in the same
        settlement. This cost reduction applies only to the first constructed
        building of the types listed in this line. For example, an Academy
        halves the cost of your next Library in that settlement; if you build a
        second Library in that settlement, you pay the normal cost for it. If 2
        buildings give the same discount, only one discount applies per new
        building, but you may construct 2 buildings at the discounted cost. For
        example, Market and Theater both halve the cost of an Inn; if your
        settlement has a Market and a Theater, you may construct 2 Inns at half
        cost (the Market discounts one, and the Theater discounts the
        other).</p><p><strong>Limit</strong>: This lists limitations on the
        number of buildings of this type, special requirements for adjacent
        buildings, or prohibitions against certain buildings being
        adjacent.</p><p>For most buildings, you can construct as many of them as
        you want in a settlement, but some are limited in the number that can be
        built per settlement or district. For example, you can only construct 1
        Arena per settlement.</p><p>Some buildings require that you construct
        them adjacent to at least 1 or 2 of a specific kind of building or
        feature of the settlement. For example, a Shop or Tavern must be
        adjacent to a House or Mansion. The required adjacent building can only
        count toward 1 building that requires it. For example, if you have a
        House and a Shop, that House can't be used to meet the requirement for
        another Shop or a Tavern; you have to construct a new House and use it
        to meet the requirement of the new Shop or Tavern.</p><p>Some buildings
        cannot be adjacent to certain buildings. For example, you can't
        construct a Tannery next to a House, Mansion, Noble Villa, or Tenement.
        If you want to use a lot for this type of building, you must demolish
        all prohibited adjacent structures first (see Demolition).</p><p>If you
        get overzealous in constructing a particular type of building in a
        settlement, the GM should feel free to add events to discourage this
        practice. For example, a settlement with too many Dumps is prone to
        otyugh and wererat attacks, and a settlement with too many Graveyards
        tends to have frequent undead attacks. This should not occur, however,
        if you build too many Houses, Parks, Tenements, or
        Waterways.</p><p><strong>Upgrade To/From</strong>: Some buildings can be
        converted into a more advanced form of the existing building, such as
        converting a Shrine into a Temple. To upgrade a building, pay the BP
        cost difference between the current building and the new building.
        Remove the modifiers from the old building and apply the modifiers from
        the new building. Upgrading counts as constructing a building for the
        purpose of the maximum number of buildings you can construct on your
        turn. You can't upgrade a building to a larger one if there isn't space
        in the District Grid for the building's new
        size.</p><p><strong>Special</strong>: This lists any other effect the
        building has, such as increasing Defense, the settlement's base value,
        or the output of a nearby Mine.</p><p><strong>Magic Items</strong>: This
        lists any magic item slot the building creates, which may be filled in
        the Upkeep phase (see Magic Items in Settlements). If a building lists
        multiple options within a category (such as "1 minor potion or wondrous
        item"), it has an equal chance for each
        option.</p><p><strong>Settlement: </strong>This lists settlement
        modifiers from page 205 of the Pathfinder RPG GameMastery Guide that
        affect specific skills within the settlement. These modifiers are
        ongoing from turn to turn, but apply only to skill checks within that
        settlement (not other settlements in the hex or anywhere else in your
        kingdom). Note that the GameMastery Guide also uses a settlement
        statistic called Economy; to avoid confusion with the Economy kingdom
        score, this book renames the Economy settlement statistic
        "Productivity."</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>These buildings are tokens
        within the Kingdom Building token folder. You can drop these onto a
        district grid to represent the various grids of your city.</p>
