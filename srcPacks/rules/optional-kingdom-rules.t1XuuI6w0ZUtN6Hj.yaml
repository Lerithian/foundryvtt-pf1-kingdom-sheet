        <p>If a building requires another to be adjacent (such as how a Tavern
        must be adjacent to a House or Mansion), and that required building is
        demolished or destroyed, the GM may decide that the associated building
        goes out of business or otherwise shuts down 1d3 turns later because of
        lack of customers or support. If this occurs, you lose the buildingâ€™s
        benefit and Unrest increases by 1.</p><p>If you build a replacement for
        the abandoned building, on the next Upkeep phase you may attempt an
        Economy check to activate the abandoned building; success means the
        abandoned building is occupied and provides its bonuses. If you fail,
        you may keep trying on the next turn.</p>

        <p>Instead of Cathedrals, Shrines, and Temples providing the same
        bonuses to Economy, Loyalty, and Stability regardless of that
        building&rsquo;s religious affiliation, they can instead provide a bonus
        to an attribute related to the alignment of the god worshiped.</p><p>A
        Temple increases attributes as follows: </p><ul><li><em>Chaotic</em>:
        Loyalty +2</li><li><em>Evil</em>: Economy +2</li><li><em>Good</em>:
        Loyalty +2</li><li><em>Lawful</em>: Economy +2</li><li><em>Neutral</em>:
        Stability +2

        <ul><li>Apply this twice if the god&rsquo;s alignment is simply Neutral,
        not Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral. </li></ul></li></ul><p>A
        Cathedral increases these attributes by 4 instead of 2. A Shrine
        increases one attribute, and only by 1; for example, a lawful good
        Shrine increases Economy by 1 or Loyalty by 1.</p><p>Instead of granting
        alignment-based bonuses, a religious building may grant bonuses based on
        the portfolio of its chosen god. For example, a Temple of the goddess of
        wine may increase Economy and Loyalty (the same attributes as a Tavern)
        each by 2, and a Temple of the god of greed may increase Economy and
        Stability (the same attributes as a Black Market) each by 2. These
        values replace the building&rsquo;s normal modifiers to Economy,
        Loyalty, and Stability, and should never provide bonuses greater than
        the building&rsquo;s normal bonuses (+1 for a Shrine, +4 for a Temple,
        +8 for a Cathedral).</p>

        <p>As explained in the Buildings section, the Settlement entry for a
        building lists modifiers that affect skill checks in the
        settlement.</p><p> If the GM wants these modifiers to influence the
        kingdom as a whole, add up the Settlement modifiers for all settlements
        in your kingdom, divide them by 10, and apply the following adjustments
        according to your kingdom&rsquo;s alignment:
        </p><ul><li><em>Chaotic</em>: +1 Crime</li><li><em>Evil</em>: +1
        Corruption</li><li><em>Good</em>: +1 Society</li><li><em>Lawful</em> +1
        Law</li><li><em>Neutral</em>: +1 Lore 

        <ul><li>Apply this twice if the kingdom&rsquo;s alignment is simply
        Neutral, not Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral.
        </li></ul></li></ul><p>Use these total modifiers everywhere in your
        kingdom. If a settlement has its own settlement modifier, use the higher
        of the two modifiers for rolls relating to that settlement.</p>

        <p>Kingdoms gain notoriety for the actions of their leaders and
        citizens, as well as for constructing certain types of buildings. This
        leads to the development of Fame or Infamy. Fame represents a positive
        perception of a kingdom&mdash;it&rsquo;s seen as a place of culture,
        learning, peace, and honor&mdash;as well as reflecting its measure of
        success in diplomacy, trade, and battle. Infamy represents a negative
        perception of a kingdom&mdash;it&rsquo;s perceived as treacherous,
        corrupt, prejudiced, ruthlessly warmongering, and villainous.</p><p>As a
        kingdom grows, it can gain and lose both Fame and Infamy, but these are
        not opposite statistics&mdash;an increase in Fame does not mean an equal
        decrease in Infamy. For example, a kingdom may be famous for culture and
        learning as well as infamous for treachery and corruption.</p><p>These
        Fame and Infamy values are not associated with the <a
        href="https://www.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Reputation%20and%20Fame&amp;Category=Campaign%20Systems">Reputation
        and Fame campaign system</a>.</p><p><strong>Starting Values</strong>:
        When you found a kingdom, it starts with Fame 1 or Infamy 1
        (Ruler&rsquo;s choice). The other value starts at 0. Fame and Infamy
        cannot go below 0. Certain buildings (such as Arenas and Castles)
        increase Fame. Some events (such as Squatters or Visiting Celebrity) can
        increase or reduce Fame or Infamy. </p><p><strong>Settlement
        Modifiers</strong>: Add all the Lore and Society modifiers from all your
        settlements and divide by 10; add this amount to your Fame. Add all the
        Corruption and Crime modifiers from all your settlements and divide by
        10; add this amount to your Infamy.</p><p><strong>Size
        Increases</strong>: When your kingdom&rsquo;s Size increases to 11, 26,
        51, 101, and 201, Fame or Infamy (Ruler&rsquo;s choice) increases by 1.
        </p><p><strong>Using Fame and Infamy</strong>: Fame and Infamy affect
        skill checks relating to other kingdoms. For every 10 points of your
        kingdom&rsquo;s Fame, your citizens gain a +1 bonus on Diplomacy checks
        to influence government officials of other kingdoms. For every 10 points
        of your kingdom&rsquo;s Infamy, your citizens gain a +1 bonus on
        Intimidate checks to influence government officials of other
        kingdoms.</p>

        <p>The kingdom-building rules presume your government is a feudal
        monarchy; the leaders are appointed for life (either by themselves or an
        outside agency such as a nearby monarch), and pass their titles to their
        heirs. The form of government you choose can help establish the flavor
        and feel of the kingdom and also adjust its settlements&rsquo;
        modifiers. You may choose one of the following as the kingdom&rsquo;s
        government. </p><p><strong>Autocracy</strong>: A single person rules the
        kingdom by popular acclaim. This person may be elected by the people, a
        popular hero asked to lead, or even a hereditary monarch who rules with
        a light hand. <em>Modifiers</em>:
        None.</p><p><strong>Magocracy</strong>: An individual or group with
        potent magical power leads the kingdom and promotes the spread of
        magical and mundane knowledge and education. Those with magical
        abilities often enjoy favored status in the kingdom. <em>Modifiers</em>:
        Lore +2, Productivity &ndash;1, Society
        &ndash;1.</p><p><strong>Oligarchy</strong>: A group of councilors, guild
        masters, aristocrats, and other wealthy and powerful individuals meet in
        council to lead the kingdom and direct its policies. <em>Modifiers</em>:
        Corruption +1, Law &ndash;1, Lore &ndash;1, Society
        +1.</p><p><strong>Overlord</strong>: The kingdom&rsquo;s ruler is a
        single individual who either seized control or inherited command of the
        settlement and maintains a tight grasp on power. <em>Modifiers</em>:
        Corruption +1, Crime &ndash;1, Law +1, Society &ndash;1.
        </p><p><strong>Republic</strong>: The kingdom is ruled by a parliament
        of elected or appointed officials who represent the various geographic
        areas and cultural constituents of the kingdom, making decisions for the
        whole through voting, bureaucratic procedures, and coalition-building.
        <em>Modifiers</em>: Crime &ndash;1, Law &ndash;1, Productivity +1,
        Society +1. </p><p><strong>Secret Syndicate</strong>: An unofficial or
        illegal group like a thieves&rsquo; guild rules the kingdom&mdash;the
        group may use a puppet leader to maintain secrecy, but the group pulls
        the strings. <em>Modifiers</em>: Corruption +1, Crime +1, Law &ndash;3,
        Productivity +1. </p><p><strong>Theocracy</strong>: The kingdom is ruled
        by the leader of its most popular religion, and the ideas and members of
        that religion often enjoy favored status in government and the kingdom.
        <em>Modifiers</em>: Corruption &ndash;1, Law +1, Lore +1, Society
        &ndash;1.</p>

        <p>Each leadership role provides bonuses to kingdom statistics based on
        one of the leader&rsquo;s ability scores. The GM may want to allow a
        leader&rsquo;s ranks in a relevant skill (such as Diplomacy or
        Intimidate) to also affect the kingdom statistics. For every 5 full
        ranks in a relevant skill, the leader may increase the leadership
        modifier by an additional 1. These skill-based additional bonuses modify
        the standard leadership role bonuses in the same way that the Leadership
        feat grants additional bonuses.</p><p>The relevant skills for each

        of the kingdom rules, the GM can ignore the options and only use the

        introduce more math into kingdom-building and use complex formulas to

        to keep or discard them if they interfere with the campaignâ€™s intended
        style of play.</p>
