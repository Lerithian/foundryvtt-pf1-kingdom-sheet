        <p>As explained in the Buildings section, the Settlement entry for a
        building lists modifiers that affect skill checks in the
        settlement.</p><p>If the GM wants these modifiers to influence the
        kingdom as a whole, add up the Settlement modifiers for all settlements
        in your kingdom, divide them by 10, and apply the following adjustments
        according to your kingdom’s alignment:</p><ul><li><p>Chaotic: +1
        Crime;</p></li><li><p>Evil: +1 Corruption;</p></li><li><p>Good: +1
        Society;</p></li><li><p>Lawful +1 Law;</p></li><li><p>Neutral: +1 Lore
        (apply this twice if the kingdom’s alignment is simply Neutral, not
        Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral).</p></li></ul><p>Use these total
        modifiers everywhere in your kingdom. If a settlement has its own
        settlement modifier, use the higher of the two modifiers for rolls
        relating to that settlement.</p>

        <p>Kingdoms gain notoriety for the actions of their leaders and
        citizens, as well as for constructing certain types of buildings. This
        leads to the development of Fame or Infamy. Fame represents a positive
        perception of a kingdom—it’s seen as a place of culture, learning,
        peace, and honor—as well as reflecting its measure of success in
        diplomacy, trade, and battle. Infamy represents a negative perception of
        a kingdom—it’s perceived as treacherous, corrupt, prejudiced, ruthlessly
        warmongering, and villainous.</p><p>As a kingdom grows, it can gain and
        lose both Fame and Infamy, but these are not opposite statistics—an
        increase in Fame does not mean an equal decrease in Infamy. For example,
        a kingdom may be famous for culture and learning as well as infamous for
        treachery and corruption.</p><p>These Fame and Infamy values are not
        associated with the Reputation and Fame campaign
        system.</p><p><strong>Starting Values</strong>: When you found a
        kingdom, it starts with Fame 1 or Infamy 1 (Ruler’s choice). The other
        value starts at 0. Fame and Infamy cannot go below 0. Certain buildings
        (such as Arenas and Castles) increase Fame. Some events (such as
        Squatters or Visiting Celebrity) can increase or reduce Fame or
        Infamy.</p><p><strong>Settlement Modifiers</strong>: Add all the Lore
        and Society modifiers from all your settlements and divide by 10; add
        this amount to your Fame. Add all the Corruption and Crime modifiers
        from all your settlements and divide by 10; add this amount to your
        Infamy.</p><p><strong>Size Increases</strong>: When your kingdom’s Size
        increases to 11, 26, 51, 101, and 201, Fame or Infamy (Ruler’s choice)
        increases by 1.</p><p><strong>Using Fame and Infamy</strong>: Fame and
        Infamy affect skill checks relating to other kingdoms. For every 10
        points of your kingdom’s Fame, your citizens gain a +1 bonus on
        Diplomacy checks to influence government officials of other kingdoms.
        For every 10 points of your kingdom’s Infamy, your citizens gain a +1
        bonus on Intimidate checks to influence government officials of other
        kingdoms.</p>

        <p>The kingdom-building rules presume your government is a feudal
        monarchy; the leaders are appointed for life (either by themselves or an
        outside agency such as a nearby monarch), and pass their titles to their
        heirs. The form of government you choose can help establish the flavor
        and feel of the kingdom and also adjust its settlements’ modifiers. You
        may choose one of the following as the kingdom’s
        government.</p><p><strong>Autocracy</strong>: A single person rules the
        kingdom by popular acclaim. This person may be elected by the people, a
        popular hero asked to lead, or even a hereditary monarch who rules with
        a light hand. <strong>Modifiers</strong>:
        None.</p><p><strong>Magocracy</strong>: An individual or group with
        potent magical power leads the kingdom and promotes the spread of
        magical and mundane knowledge and education. Those with magical
        abilities often enjoy favored status in the kingdom.
        <strong>Modifiers</strong>: Lore +2, Productivity –1, Society
        –1.</p><p><strong>Oligarchy</strong>: A group of councilors, guild
        masters, aristocrats, and other wealthy and powerful individuals meet in
        council to lead the kingdom and direct its policies.
        <strong>Modifiers</strong>: Corruption +1, Law –1, Lore –1, Society
        +1.</p><p><strong>Overlord</strong>: The kingdom’s ruler is a single
        individual who either seized control or inherited command of the
        settlement and maintains a tight grasp on power.
        <strong>Modifiers</strong>: Corruption +1, Crime –1, Law +1, Society
        –1.</p><p><strong>Republic</strong>: The kingdom is ruled by a
        parliament of elected or appointed officials who represent the various
        geographic areas and cultural constituents of the kingdom, making
        decisions for the whole through voting, bureaucratic procedures, and
        coalition-building. <strong>Modifiers</strong>: Crime –1, Law –1,
        Productivity +1, Society +1.</p><p><strong>Secret Syndicate</strong>: An
        unofficial or illegal group like a thieves’ guild rules the kingdom—the
        group may use a puppet leader to maintain secrecy, but the group pulls
        the strings. <strong>Modifiers</strong>: Corruption +1, Crime +1, Law
        –3, Productivity +1.</p><p><strong>Theocracy</strong>: The kingdom is
        ruled by the leader of its most popular religion, and the ideas and
        members of that religion often enjoy favored status in government and
        the kingdom. <strong>Modifiers</strong>: Corruption –1, Law +1, Lore +1,
        Society –1.</p>

        <p>Each leadership role provides bonuses to kingdom statistics based on
        one of the leader’s ability scores. The GM may want to allow a leader’s
        ranks in a relevant skill (such as Diplomacy or Intimidate) to also
        affect the kingdom statistics. For every 5 full ranks in a relevant
        skill, the leader may increase the leadership modifier by an additional
        1. These skill-based additional bonuses modify the standard leadership
        role bonuses in the same way that the Leadership feat grants additional
        bonuses.</p><p>The relevant skills for each leadership role are as
        follows.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ambassador</strong>:
        Diplomacy</p></li><li><p><strong>Consort</strong>: Knowledge
