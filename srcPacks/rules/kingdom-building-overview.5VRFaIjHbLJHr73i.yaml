        <p>Some heroes found kingdoms, driving out hostile monsters to make room
        for peaceful settlers. Others lead soldiers into battle, waging great
        and terrible wars. This chapter presents rules for building a kingdom
        and waging war that focus on the larger tactics of city planning and
        troop strategy rather than managing details of individual settlers and
        soldiers.</p><p>This manuel uses “kingdom” as a universal term to
        represent all kinds of domains, regardless of size, form of government,
        and gender of the ruler. Most of the decisions are in the hands of the
        players, and these rules are written with that assumption, using terms
        like “your kingdom” and “your army.” However, the GM is still in charge
        of the campaign, and is expected to make judgments about the
        repercussions of player decisions. While players running a kingdom
        should be allowed to read these rules (having them do so makes much of
        the kingdom building easier for the GM), the players shouldn’t think
        they can abuse these rules to exploit weird corner cases. For example,
        players may decide to construct a city full of graveyards because of the
        bonuses they provide to the city, but if the GM believes that is
        unreasonable, he could decide that the city is prone to frequent undead
        attacks. Likewise, a settlement with more magic shops than houses and
        businesses may slowly become a ghost town as all the normal citizens
        move elsewhere out of superstitious fear. As with a normal campaign, the
        GM is the final arbiter of the rules, and can make adjustments to events
        as necessary for the campaign.</p><h1>Kingdom Building</h1><p>Ruling a
        kingdom is a complex and difficult task, one undertaken only by the very
        ambitious. Many PCs are content to live as mercenaries or treasure
        hunters, no interest in being responsible for the health and well-being
        of subjects; for these characters, a kingdom is simply a place they pass
        through on the way to the next adventure. However, characters who are
        keen to spread their wings and forge a place of power and inf luence in
        the world can use this chapter to create a different sort of campaign.
        If the PCs are interested in ruling only a single town or castle and the
        small region around it, kingdom building can focus primarily on the
        settlement and the PCs’ personal demesne. If the PCs have larger goals,
        such as carving out a new, independent kingdom, these rules allow them
        to build cities and engage in trade, diplomacy, and war.</p><p>These
        rules assume that all of the kingdom’s leaders are focused on making the
        kingdom prosperous and stable, rather than oppressing the citizens and
        stealing from the treasury. Likewise, the rules assume that the leaders
        are working together, not competing with each other or working at odds.
        If the campaign begins to step into those areas, the GM is free to
        introduce new rules to deal with these activities.</p><p>Like the
        exploration system, the kingdombuilding rules measure terrain in hexes.
        Each hex is 12 miles from corner to corner, representing an area of just
        less than 95 square miles. The hex measurement is an abstraction; the
        hexes are easy to quantify and allow the GM to categorize a large area
        as one terrain type without having to worry about precise borders of
        forests and other terrain features.</p><h1>Overview</h1><p>The key parts
        of the kingdom-building rules that you’ll be referencing are as
        follows:</p><p>• Explanation of the kingdom terminology used throughout
        this chapter.</p><p>• Step-by-step instructions for founding a
        kingdom.</p><p>• The turn sequence for an established kingdom.</p><p>•
        The game statistics for terrain improvements.</p><p>• Step-by-step
        instructions on how to found your first settlement.</p><p>• The game
        statistics for the types of buildings.</p><p>• The settlement District
        Grid.</p><p>• The kingdom sheet.</p><p>Following the main rules and the
        types of buildings are several optional rules for kingdom building, such
        as modifying the effect of religious buildings based on alignment or
        deity portfolio, tracking Fame and Infamy scores for your kingdom, rules
        for different types of government, and special edicts you can declare
        during the turn sequence.</p>

        <p>A major part of the Kingmaker Adventure Path is the PCs' creation of
        a kingdom and the cities within its borders. This article presents rules
        for creating kingdoms and cities. Like characters, kingdoms use sheets
        to track their statistics. See Notes for a kingdom sheet. Use the
        following notes to fill in a kingdom's initial
        values.</p><h1>Alignment</h1><p>Like a PC, your kingdom has an
        alignment, which you decide when you form the kingdom. The kingdom's
        alignment represents the majority outlook and behavior of the people
        within that kingdom when they're considered as a group. (Individual
        citizens and even some leaders may be of different
        alignments.)</p><ul><li>When you decide on your kingdom's alignment,
        apply the following adjustments to the kingdom's statistics: Chaotic: +2
        Loyalty</li><li>Evil: +2 Economy</li><li>Good: +2
        Loyalty</li><li>Lawful: +2 Economy</li><li>Neutral: Stability +2
        <ul><li>(Apply this twice if the kingdom's alignment is simply Neutral,
        not Chaotic Neutral or Lawful Neutral).</li></ul></li></ul><p>A
        kingdom's alignment rarely changes, though at the GM's option, it can
        shift through the actions of its rulers or its people.</p><h1>Capital
        City</h1><p>A kingdom should have a capital city - the seat of your
        power. Your first settlement is your capital. If you want to designate a
        different settlement as the capital, you may do so in Step 6 of the
        Edict phase. Your capital city primarily comes into play if your kingdom
        loses hexes. If you change the capital city, attempt a Stability check.
        Success means Unrest increases by 1; failure means Unrest increases by
        1d6.</p><h1>Size</h1><p>This is how many hexes the kingdom claims. A new
        kingdom's Size is 1. This affects a kingdoms consumption and its control
        DC.</p><h1>Population</h1><p>Actual population numbers don't factor into
        your kingdom's statistics but can be fun to track anyway. The population
        of your kingdom is equal to the population of all your
        settlements.</p><p>A settlement's population is approximately equal to
        the number of completed lots within its districts × 250. A grid that has
        all 36 lots filled with buildings has a population of approximately
        9,000.</p><h1>Build Points</h1><p>The units of a kingdom's wealth and
        productivity are build points (BP). Build points are an abstraction
        representing the kingdom's expendable assets, not just gold in the
        treasury. Build points include raw materials (such as livestock, lumber,
        land, seed, and ore), tangible goods (such as wagons, weapons, and
        candles), and people (artisans, laborers, and colonists). Together,
        these assets represent the labor and productive output of your
        citizens.</p><p>You spend BP on tasks necessary to develop and protect
        your kingdom - planting farms, creating roads, constructing buildings,
        raising armies, and so on. These things are made at your command, but
        they are not yours. The cities, roads, farms, and buildings belong to
        the citizens who build them and use them to live and work every day, and
        those acts of living and working create more BP for the kingdom. As the
        leaders, you use your power and influence to direct the economic and
        constructive activity of your kingdom, deciding what gets built, when,
        and where.</p><p>Build points don't have a precise exchange rate to gold
        pieces because they don't represent exact amounts of specific resources.
        For example, you can't really equate the productivity of a blacksmith
        with that of a stable, as their goods are used for different things and
        aren't produced at the same rate, but both of them contribute to a
        kingdom's overall economy. In general, 1 BP is worth approximately 4,000
        gp; use this value to get a sense of how costly various kingdom
        expenditures are. In practice, it is not a simple matter to convert one
        currency to the other, but there are certain ways for your PC to spend
        gp to increase the kingdom's BP or withdraw BP and turn them into gold
        for your character to spend.</p><h1>Consumption</h1><p>Consumption
        indicates how many BP are required to keep the kingdom functioning each
        month. Your kingdom's Consumption is equal to its Size, modified by
        settlements and terrain improvements (such as Farms and Fisheries).
        Consumption can never go below 0</p><h1>Treasury</h1><p>As your kingdom
        earns money, favors, resources, and power, its Build Point total
        increases. In the Kingmaker Adventure Path, you begin with 50 BP in your
        kingdom's treasury (this amount is bestowed upon you by the swordlords
        of Restov).</p><h1>Control DC</h1><p>Some kingdom actions require a
        check (1d20 + modifiers) to succeed - this is known as a control check.
        The base DC for a control check is equal to 20 + the kingdom's Size in
        hexes + the total number of districts in all your settlements + any
        other modifiers from special circumstances or effects. Unless otherwise
        stated, the DC of a kingdom check is the Control DC.</p><h1>Kingdom
        Check</h1><p>A kingdom has three attributes: Economy, Loyalty, and
        Stability. Your kingdom's initial scores in each of these attributes is
        0, plus modifiers for kingdom alignment, bonuses provided by the
        leaders, and any other modifiers.</p><p>Many kingdom actions and events
        require you to attempt a kingdom check, either using your Economy,
        Loyalty, or Stability attribute (1d20 + the appropriate attribute +
        other modifiers). You cannot take 10 or take 20 on a kingdom check.
        Kingdom checks automatically fail on a natural 1 and automatically
        succeed on a natural 20.</p><h1>Economy</h1><p>This attribute measures
        the productivity of your kingdom's workers and the vibrancy of its
        trade, both in terms of money and in terms of information, innovation,
        and technology. Your kingdom's initial Economy is 0 plus your kingdom's
        alignment and leadership modifiers.</p><h1>Loyalty</h1><p>Loyalty refers
        to the sense of goodwill among your people, their ability to live
        peaceably together even in times of crisis, and to fight for one another
        when needed. Your kingdom's initial Loyalty is 0 plus your kingdom's
        alignment and any modifiers from your kingdom's leadership
        role.</p><h1>Stability</h1><p>Stability refers to the physical and
        social well-being of the kingdom, from the health and security of its
        citizenry to the vitality of its natural resources and its ability to
        maximize their use. Your kingdom's initial Stability is 0 plus your
        kingdom's alignment and leadership modifiers.</p><h1>Unrest</h1><p>Your
        kingdom's Unrest indicates how rebellious your citizens are. Your
        kingdom's initial Unrest is 0. Unrest can never fall below 0 (anything
        that would modify it to less than 0 is wasted). Subtract your kingdom's
        Unrest from all Economy, Loyalty, and Stability checks.</p><p>If your
        kingdom's Unrest is 11 or higher, the kingdom begins to lose control of
        hexes it has claimed.</p><p>If your kingdom's Unrest ever reaches 20,
        the kingdom falls into anarchy (see Upkeep Phase).</p>
