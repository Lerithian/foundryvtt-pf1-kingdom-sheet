        <p><strong>1st Settlement</strong>. Start by creating the first
        settlement.</p><p>Once you have your first settlement, you have the
        start of a kingdom. You'll need to make some initial decisions that
        affect your kingdom's statistics, and record them on the kingdom
        sheet.</p><p><strong>Choose Your Kingdom's Alignment. </strong>Your
        kingdom's alignment helps determine how loyal, prosperous, and stable
        your kingdom is. Your kingdom may be a lawful good bastion against a
        nearby land of devil worshipers, or a chaotic neutral territory of
        cutthroat traders whose government does very little to interfere with
        the rights of its citizens.</p><p>When you decide on your kingdom's
        alignment, apply the following adjustments to the kingdom's
        statistics:</p><ul><li>Chaotic: +2 Loyalty;</li><li>Evil: +2
        Economy;</li><li>Good: +2 Loyalty;</li><li>Lawful: +2
        Economy;</li><li>Neutral: Stability +2 (apply this twice if the
        kingdom's alignment is simply Neutral, not Chaotic Neutral or Lawful
        Neutral).</li></ul><p><strong>Choose Leadership Roles. </strong>Assign
        the leadership roles for all PCs and NPCs involved in running the
        kingdom, such as Ruler, General, and High Priest. The leadership roles
        provide bonuses on checks made to collect taxes, deal with rioting
        citizens, and resolve similar issues.</p><p><strong>Start Your Treasury.
        </strong>The build points you have left over from starting your first
        settlement make up your initial Treasury.</p><p><strong>Determine Your
        Kingdom's Attributes. </strong>Your initial Economy, Loyalty, and
        Stability scores are based on the kingdom's alignment and the buildings
        your settlement has. (If you start with more than one settlement,
        include all the settlements in this reckoning.)</p><p>Once you've
        completed these steps, move on to Kingdom Turn Sequence - Edict
        Phase</p>

        <p>A stable kingdom has leaders that fill different roles - tending to
        the economy, defense, and health of its citizens. PCs and NPCs can fill
        these roles; your fighter may be the kingdom's Warden, the party cleric
        its High Priest, and so on. Each role grants the kingdom different
        benefits.</p><p>A character can only fill one leadership role at a time.
        For example, your character can't be both the Ruler and the High Priest.
        Even if you want the Ruler to be the head of the kingdom's religion,
        she's too busy ruling to also do the work of a High Priest; she'll have
        to appoint someone else to do that work.</p><p>The kingdom must have
        someone in the Ruler role to function; without a Ruler, the kingdom
        cannot perform basic actions and gains Unrest every turn. All other
        roles are optional, though leaving certain roles vacant gives your
        kingdom penalties. These leadership roles can be a part of any form of
        government; in some kingdoms they take the form of a formal ruling
        council, while in others they may be advisors, ministers, relatives of
        the leader, or simply powerful nobles, merchants, or bureaucrats with
        access to the seat of power. The names of these roles are game terms and
        need not correspond to the titles of those roles in the kingdom - the
        Ruler of your kingdom may be called king, queen, chosen one, padishah,
        overlord, sultan, and so on.</p><p><strong>Responsibilities of
        Leadership:</strong> In order to gain the benefits of leadership, you
        must spend at least 7 days per month attending to your duties; these
        days need not be consecutive. This can be roleplayed or can be assumed
        to run in the background without needing to be defined or actively
        played out. Time spent ruling cannot be used for adventuring, crafting
        magic items, or completing other downtime activities (see Chapter 2)
        that require your full attention and participation. Failure to complete
        your duties during a turn means treating the role as thought it's
        vacant.</p><p>For most campaigns, it's best to have the PCs pick the
        same days of the month for these administrative duties, so everyone is
        available for adventuring at the same time.</p><p><strong>PCs and NPCs
        as Leaders:</strong> These rules include enough important leadership
        roles that a small group of PCs can't fill them all. You may have to
        recruit NPCs to fill out the remaining necessary roles for your kingdom.
        Cohorts, followers, and even intelligent familiars or similar companions
        can fill leadership roles, and you may want to consider inviting allied
        NPCs to become rulers, such as asking a friendly ranger you rescued to
        become the kingdom's Marshal.</p><p><strong>Abdicating a Role:</strong>
        If you want to step down from a leadership position, you must find a
        replacement to avoid incurring the appropriate vacancy penalty for your
        position. Abdicating a position increases Unrest by 1 and requires a
        Loyalty check; if the check fails, the vacancy penalty applies for 1
        turn while the new leader transitions into that role. If you are the
        Ruler, abdicating increases Unrest by 2 instead of 1, and you take a -4
        penalty on the Loyalty check to avoid the vacancy penalty.</p><p>If you
        are not the Ruler and are leaving one leadership role to take a
        different one in the kingdom, the Unrest increase does not occur and you
        gain a +4 bonus on the Loyalty check to avoid the vacancy
        penalty.</p><p><strong>Leader Statistics:</strong> The statistics for
        the different roles are presented as follows.</p><p><em>Benefit:</em>
        This explains the benefit to your kingdom if you have a character in
        this role. If you have the Leadership feat, increase this benefit by 1.
        If this section gives you a choice of two ability scores, use whichever
        is highest.</p><p>Most benefits are constant and last as long as there
        is a character in that role, but don't stack with themselves. For
        example, a General increases Loyalty by 2, so the General provides a
        constant +2 to the kingdom's Loyalty (not a stacking +2 increase every
        turn), which goes away if she dies or resigns. If a benefit mentions a
        particular phase in kingdom building, that benefit applies every turn
        during that phase. For example, the Royal Enforcer decreases Unrest by 1
        at every Upkeep phase.</p><p><em>Vacancy Penalty:</em> This line
        explains the penalty to your kingdom if no character fills this role, or
        if the leader fails to spend the necessary time fulfilling his
        responsibilities. Some roles have no vacancy penalty. If a character in
        a role is killed or permanently incapacitated during a turn and not
        restored to health by the start of the next kingdom turn, that role
        counts as vacant for that next turn, after which a replacement can be
        appointed to the role.</p><p>Like benefits, most vacancy penalties are
        constant, last as long as that role is vacant, and don't stack with
        themselves. If a vacant role lists an increase to Unrest, however, that
        increase does not go away when the role is filled. For example, if the
        kingdom doesn't have a ruler for a turn, Unrest increases by 4 and
        doesn't automatically return to its previous level when you eventually
        fill the vacant Ruler role.</p><h1>Who Rolls the Kingdom
        Check?</h1><p>Running a kingdom is more fun if all the players are
        involved and each is responsible for making some of the kingdom checks.
        Who makes each roll depends on the players in your group and what roles
        they want to play. Some players may not want to make any of these rolls.
        You may want to start with the following die roll responsibilities and
        modify them to suit your kingdom and the other
        players.</p><p><strong>Ruler:</strong> Loyalty checks, any checks or
        edicts not covered by other rulers</p><p><strong>Consort:</strong> As
        Ruler when Ruler is unavailable</p><p><strong>Councilor:</strong>
        Holiday edicts</p><p><strong>General:</strong> Kingdom checks for events
        requiring combat</p><p><strong>Grand Diplomat:</strong> Diplomatic
        edicts (optional rule)</p><p><strong>Heir:</strong> As Ruler when Ruler
        is unavailable</p><p><strong>High Priest:</strong> Holiday edicts, rolls
        to generate magic items from Cathedrals, Shrines, and
        Temples</p><p><strong>Magister:</strong> Rolls to generate magic items
        not rolled by the High Priest</p><p><strong>Marshal:</strong>
        Exploration edicts (optional rule)</p><p><strong>Royal
        Enforcer:</strong> Loyalty checks to reduce Unrest or prevent Unrest
        increases</p><p><strong>Spymaster:</strong> Kingdom checks involving
        crime and foreigners</p><p><strong>Treasurer:</strong> Economy checks,
        Taxation edicts</p><p><strong>Viceroy:</strong> Vassalage edicts
        (optional rule)</p><p><strong>Warden:</strong> Stability
        checks</p><h1>Ruler</h1><p>The Ruler is the highest-ranking person in
        the kingdom, above even the other kingdom leaders, and is expected to
        embody the values of the kingdom. The Ruler performs the kingdom's most
        important ceremonies (such as knighting royals and signing treaties), is
        the kingdom's chief diplomatic officer (though most of these duties are
        handled by the Grand Diplomat), is the signatory for all laws affecting
        the entire kingdom, pardons criminals when appropriate, and is
        responsible for appointing characters to all other high positions in the
        government (such as other leadership roles, mayors of settlements, and
        judges).</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Choose one kingdom attribute
        (Economy, Loyalty, or Stability). Add your Charisma modifier to this
        attribute.</p><p>If your kingdom's Size is 26-100, choose a second
        kingdom attribute and add your Charisma modifier to it as well.</p><p>If
        your kingdom's Size is 101 or more, choose a third kingdom attribute and
        add your Charisma modifier to it too.</p><p>If you have the Leadership
        feat, the bonus from the feat applies to all kingdom attributes you
        affect (one, two, or three attributes, depending on the kingdom's Size).
        If you marry someone of equal station, you both can act as Ruler. You
        both add your Charisma modifiers to the kingdom attribute (or
        attributes, if the kingdom is large enough). As long as one of you is
        present for 1 week per month, you avoid the vacancy penalty. In a
        typical campaign where the kingdom leaders have no ties to actual
        nobility, \"someone of equal station\" is irrelevant and your marriage
        is between two Rulers. In a campaign where the leaders are nobles or
        royals, marrying someone of lesser station means the spouse becomes a
        Consort rather than a Ruler</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty:</strong> A
        kingdom without a ruler cannot claim new hexes, create Farms, build
        Roads, or purchase settlement districts. Unrest increases by 4 during
        the kingdom's Upkeep phase.</p><h1>Consort</h1><p>The Consort is usually
        the spouse of the Ruler, and spends time attending court, speaking with
        and advising nobles, touring the kingdom to lift the spirits of the
        people, and so on. In most kingdoms, you cannot have two married Rulers
        and a Consort at the same time.</p><p>The Consort represents the Ruler
        when the Ruler is occupied or otherwise unable to act. With the Ruler's
        permission, the Consort may perform any of the Ruler's duties, allowing
        the Ruler to effectively act in two places at once. If the Ruler dies,
        the Consort may act as Ruler until the Heir comes of age and can take
        over as Ruler.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add half your Charisma
        modifier to Loyalty. If the ruler is unavailable during a turn, you may
        act as the Ruler for that turn, negating the vacancy penalty for having
        no Ruler, though you do not gain the Ruler benefit. If you act as the
        Ruler for the turn, you must succeed at a Loyalty check during the
        kingdom's Upkeep phase or Unrest increases by 1.</p><p><strong>Vacancy
        Penalty:</strong> None</p><h1>Councilor</h1><p>The Councilor acts as a
        liaison between the citizenry and the other kingdom leaders, parsing
        requests from the commonwealth and presenting the leaders' proclamations
        to the people in understandable ways. It is the Councilor's
        responsibility to make sure the Ruler is making decisions that benefit
        the kingdom's communities and its
        citizens.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add your Charisma modifier or
        Wisdom modifier to Loyalty.</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty:</strong> The
        kingdom gains no benefits from the Holiday edict. During the Upkeep
        phase, Unrest increases by 1.</p><h1>General</h1><p>The General is the
        highest-ranking member of the kingdom's military. If the kingdom has an
        army and a navy, the heads of those organizations report to the
        kingdom's General. The General is responsible for looking after the
        needs of the military and directing the kingdom's armies in times of
        war. Most citizens see the General as a protector and
        patriot.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add your Charisma modifier or
        Strength modifier to Stability.</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty:</strong>
        Loyalty decreases by 4.</p><h1>Grand Diplomat</h1><p>The Grand Diplomat
        is in charge of the kingdom's foreign policy - how it interacts with
        other kingdoms and similar political organizations such as tribes of
        intelligent monsters. The Grand Diplomat is the head of all of the
        kingdom's diplomats, envoys, and ambassadors. It is the Grand Diplomat's
        responsibility to represent and protect the interests of the kingdom
        with regard to foreign powers.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add your
        Charisma modifier or Intelligence modifier to
        Stability.</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty:</strong> Stability decreases
        by 2. The kingdom cannot issue Diplomatic or Exploration
        edicts.</p><h1>Heir</h1><p>The Heir is usually the Ruler's eldest son or
        daughter, though some kingdoms may designate a significant advisor (such
        as a seneschal) as Heir. The Heir's time is mostly spent learning to
        become a ruler-pursuing academic and martial training, touring the
        kingdom to get to the know the land and its people, experiencing the
        intrigues of courtly life, and so on.</p><p>Because the Heir carries the
        potential of being the next Ruler, the Heir's role is similar to the
        Consort in that the Heir may act on behalf of the
        Ruler.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add half your Charisma modifier
        to Loyalty. You may act as the Ruler for a turn, negating the vacancy
        penalty for the kingdom having no Ruler, though you do not gain the
        Ruler benefit. Whenever you act as the Ruler for the turn, you must
        succeed at a Loyalty check during the kingdom's Upkeep phase or Unrest
        increases by 1.</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty:</strong> None</p><h1>High
        Priest</h1><p>The High Priest tends to the kingdom's religious needs and
        guides its growth. If the kingdom has an official religion, the High
        Priest may also be the highest ranking member of that religion in the
        kingdom, and has similar responsibilities over the lesser priests of
        that faith to those the Grand Diplomat has over the kingdom's
        ambassadors and diplomats. If the kingdom has no official religion, the
        High Priest may be a representative of the most popular religion in the
        kingdom or a neutral party representing the interests of all religions
        allowed by the kingdom.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add your
        Charisma modifier or Wisdom modifier to Stability</p><p><strong>Vacancy
        Penalty:</strong> Stability and Loyalty decrease by 2. During the Upkeep
        phase, Unrest increases by 1.</p><h1>Magister</h1><p>The Magister guides
        the kingdom's higher learning and magic, promoting education and
        knowledge among the citizens and representing the interests of magic,
        science, and academia. In most kingdoms, the Magister is a sage, a
        wizard, or a priest of a deity of knowledge, and oversees the
        governmental bureaucracy except regarding
        finance.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add your Charisma modifier or
        Intelligence modifier to Economy</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty:</strong>
        Economy decreases by 4.</p><h1>Marshal</h1><p>The Marshal ensures that
        the kingdom's laws are being enforced in the remote parts of the kingdom
        as well as in the vicinity of the capital. The Marshal is also
        responsible for securing the kingdom's borders. He organizes regular
        patrols and works with the General to respond to threats that militias
        and adventurers can't deal with alone.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong>
        Add your Dexterity modifier or Wisdom modifier to
        Economy.</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty:</strong> Economy decreases by
        4.</p><h1>Royal Enforcer</h1><p>The Royal Enforcer deals with punishing
        criminals, working with the Councilor to make sure the citizens feel the
        government is adequately dealing with wrongdoers, and working with the
        Marshal to capture fugitives from the law. The Royal Enforcer may grant
        civilians the authority to kill in the name of the
        law.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add your Dexterity modifier or
        Strength modifier to Loyalty. During the Upkeep phase, you may decrease
        Unrest by 1 (this is not affected by having the Leadership feat); if you
        do so, you must succeed at a Loyalty check or Loyalty decreases by
        1.</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty:</strong>
        None</p><h1>Spymaster</h1><p>The Spymaster observes the kingdom's
        criminal elements and underworld and spies on other kingdoms. The
        Spymaster always has a finger on the pulse of the kingdom's underbelly,
        and uses acquired information to protect the interests of the kingdom at
        home and elsewhere through a network of spies and
        informants.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> During the Edict phase,
        choose one kingdom attribute (Economy, Loyalty or Stability). Add your
        Dexterity modifier or Intelligence modifier to this
        attribute.</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty:</strong> Economy decreases by
        4. During the Upkeep phase, Unrest increases by
        1.</p><h1>Treasurer</h1><p>The Treasurer monitors the state of the
        kingdom's Treasury and citizens' confidence in the value of their money
        and investigates whether any businesses are taking unfair advantage of
        the system. The Treasurer is in charge of the tax collectors and tracks
        debts and credits with guilds and other
        governments.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add your Intelligence
        modifier or Wisdom modifier to Economy.</p><p><strong>Vacancy
        Penalty:</strong> Economy decreases by 4. The kingdom cannot collect
        taxes - during the Edict phase, when you would normally collect taxes,
        the kingdom does not collect taxes at all and the taxation level is
        considered "none".</p><h1>Viceroy</h1><p>The Viceroy represents the
        Ruler's interests on an ongoing basis in a specific location such as a
        colony or vassal state. The Viceroy is in effect the Ruler for that
        territory; her orders are superceded only by direct commands from the
        Ruler.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add half your Intelligence or
        Wisdom modifier to Economy. You may assume any leadership role
        (including Ruler) for your colony or vassal state, but any benefit you
        provide in this role is 1 less than normal; if you do so, you must spend
        7 days that month performing duties appropriate to that leadership role
        in addition to the 7 days spent for Viceroy
        duties.</p><p><strong>Vacancy Penalty:</strong> If you have no Viceroy
        for your vassal state, treat it as if it had the Ruler vacancy
        penalty.</p><h1>Warden</h1><p>The Warden is responsible for enforcing
        laws in larger settlements, as well as ensuring the safety of the
        kingdom leaders. The Warden also works with the General to deploy forces
        to protect settlements and react to internal threats. The warden leads
        the city guards.</p><p><strong>Benefit:</strong> Add your Constitution
        modifier or Strength modifier to Loyalty.</p><p><strong>Vacancy
        Penalty:</strong> Loyalty and Stability decrease by 2.</p>

        <p>The units of a kingdom’s wealth and productivity are build points
        (BP). Build points are an abstraction representing the kingdom’s
        expendable assets, not just gold in the treasury. Build points include
        raw materials (such as livestock, lumber, land, seed, and ore), tangible
        goods (such as wagons, weapons, and candles), and people (artisans,
        laborers, and colonists). Together, these assets represent the labor and
        productive output of your citizens.</p><p>You spend BP on tasks
        necessary to develop and protect your kingdom—planting farms, creating
        roads, constructing buildings, raising armies, and so on. These things
        are made at your command, but they are not yours. The cities, roads,
        farms, and buildings belong to the citizens who build them and use them
        to live and work every day, and those acts of living and working create
        more BP for the kingdom. As the leaders, you use your power and
        influence to direct the economic and constructive activity of your
        kingdom, deciding what gets built, when, and where.</p><p>Build points
        don’t have a precise exchange rate to gold pieces because they don’t
        represent exact amounts of specific resources. For example, you can’t
        really equate the productivity of a blacksmith with that of a stable, as
        their goods are used for different things and aren’t produced at the
        same rate, but both of them contribute to a kingdom’s overall
        economy.</p><p>In general, 1 BP is worth approximately 4,000 gp; use
        this value to get a sense of how costly various kingdom expenditures
        are. In practice, it is not a simple matter to convert one currency to
        the other, but there are certain ways for your PC to spend gp to
        increase the kingdom’s BP or withdraw BP and turn them into gold for
        your character to spend.</p><p>Providing a seed amount of BP at the
        start of kingdom building means your kingdom isn’t starving for
        resources in the initial months. Whether you acquire these funds on your
        own or with the help of an influential NPC is decided by the GM, and
        sets the tone for much of the campaign.</p><h1>Wealthy Sponsor</h1><p>In
        many cases, a kingdom’s initial BP come from a source outside your
        party. A wealthy queen may want to tame some of the wilderness on her
        kingdom’s borders, or a merchant’s guild may want to construct a trading
        post to increase trade with distant lands. Regardless of the intent, the
        work involved to create a new settlement costs thousands of gold
        pieces—more than most adventurers would want to spend on mundane things
        like jails, mills, and piers.</p><p>It is an easy matter for the GM to
        provide these funds in the form of a quest reward. A wealthy queen may
        grant you minor titles and BP for your treasury if you kill a notorious
        bandit and turn his ruined castle into a town, or a guild may provide
        you with a ship full of goods and workers and enough BP to start a small
        colony on a newly discovered, resource-rich continent. In exchange for
        this investment, the sponsor expects you to be a vassal or close ally;
        in some cases, you may be required to pay back these BP (such as at a
        rate of 1 BP per turn) or provide tribute to the patron on an ongoing
        basis (such as at a rate of 10% of your income per turn, minimum 1
        BP).</p><p>An appropriate starting amount is 50 BP. This amount is
        enough to keep a new kingdom active for a few turns while it establishes
        its own economy, but it is still at risk of collapse from mismanagement
        or bad luck.</p><p>As the initial citizens represented by this BP
        investment are probably loyal to the sponsor, taking action against the
        sponsor may anger those people and cause trouble. For example, if you
        rebuff the queen’s envoy, your citizens may see this as a snub against
        the queen and rebel.</p><p>Your responsibility to the sponsor usually
        falls into one of the following categories, based on the loan
        arrangement.</p><p><strong>Charter:</strong> The sponsor expects you to
        explore, clear, and settle a wilderness area along the sponsor’s
        border—an area where the sponsor has some territorial claims. You may
        have to fend off other challengers for the
        land.</p><p><strong>Conquest</strong>: The sponsor’s soldiers clashed
        with the army of an existing kingdom and the kingdom’s old leaders have
        fled, surrendered, or been killed. The sponsor has placed you in command
        of this territory and the soldiers.</p><p><strong>Fief</strong>: The
        sponsor places you in charge of an existing domain within his own
        already-settled lands. If it includes already improved terrain and
        cities, you’re expected to govern and further improve them. (While
        you’ll start with land and settlements, you’ll still need around 50 BP
        to handle your kingdom’s Consumption and development
        needs.)</p><p><strong>Grant</strong>: The sponsor places you in charge
        of settling and improving an area already claimed by the liege but not
        significantly touched by civilization. You may have to expand the
        borders of the land or defend it against hostile
        creatures.</p><h1>Starting From Scratch</h1><p>It’s not easy to start a
        kingdom—probably the reason everyone doesn’t have one. If you are
        founding a kingdom on your own, without an external sponsor or a
        fantastic windfall of resources, the initial financial costs can be
        crippling to PCs. Even building a new town with just a House and an Inn
        costs 13 BP—worth over 50,000 gp in terms of stone, timber, labor, food,
        and so on. To compensate for this (and encourage you to adventure in
        search of more gold that you can convert into BP), if you’re running a
        small, self-starting kingdom, the GM may allow you to turn your gold
        into BP at a better rate. You may only take advantage of this if you
        don’t have a sponsor; it represents your people seeing the hard work
        you’re directly putting in and being inspired to do the same to get the
        kingdom off the ground.</p><p>This improved rate depends on the Size of
        your kingdom, as shown in the following
        table.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Kingdom
        Size</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Price of 1
        BP</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Withdrawal
        Rate*</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>01-25</p></td><td><p>1,000
        gp</p></td><td><p>500
        gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>26-50</p></td><td><p>2,000
        gp</p></td><td><p>1,000
        gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>51-100</p></td><td><p>3,000
        gp</p></td><td><p>1,500
        gp</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>101+</p></td><td><p>4,000
        gp</p></td><td><p>2,000 gp</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>* If you make
        a withdrawal from the Treasury during the Income Phase, use this
        withdrawal rate to determine how much gp you gain per BP
        withdrawn.</p><p>The GM may also allow you to discover a cache of goods
        worth BP (instead of gp) as a reward for adventuring, giving you the
        seed money to found or support your kingdom.</p>
