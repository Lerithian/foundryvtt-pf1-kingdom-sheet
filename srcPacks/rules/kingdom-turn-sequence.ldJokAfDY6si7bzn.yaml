        <p>A kingdom's growth occurs during four phases, which together make up
        1 kingdom turn (1 month of game time).</p><p>The four phases are as
        follows:</p><p><strong>Phase 1 - Upkeep:</strong> Check your kingdom's
        stability, pay costs, and deal with Unrest. If your kingdom controls 0
        hexes, skip the Upkeep phase and proceed to the Edict
        phase.</p><p><strong>Phase 2 - Edict:</strong> Declare official
        proclamations about taxes, diplomacy, and other kingdom-wide
        decisions.</p><p><strong>Phase 3 - Income:</strong> Add to your Treasury
        by collecting taxes and converting gp into BP, or withdraw BP from your
        kingdom for your personal use.</p><p><strong>Phase 4 - Event:</strong>
        Check whether any unusual events occur that require attention. Some are
        beneficial, such as an economic boom, good weather, or the discovery of
        remarkable treasure. Others are detrimental, such as foul weather, a
        plague, or a rampaging monster.</p><p>These phases are always undertaken
        in the above order. Many steps allow you to perform an action once per
        kingdom turn; this means once for the entire kingdom, not once per
        leader.</p>

        <p>During the Upkeep phase, you adjust your kingdom's scores based on
        what's happened in the past month, how happy the people are, how much
        they've consumed and are taxed, and so on.</p><h1>Step 1 - Determine
        Kingdom Stability</h1><p>Attempt a Stability check. If you succeed,
        Unrest decreases by 1 (if this would reduce Unrest below 0, add 1 BP to
        your Treasury instead). If you fail by 4 or less, Unrest increases by 1;
        if you fail by 5 or more, Unrest increases by 1d4</p><h1>Step 2 - Pay
        Consumption</h1><p>Subtract your kingdom's Consumption from the
        kingdom's Treasury. If your Treasury is negative after paying
        Consumption, Unrest increases by 2.</p><h1>Step 3 - Fill Vacant Magic
        Item Slots</h1><p>If any of your settlement districts have buildings
        that produce magic items (such as a Caster's Tower or Herbalist) with
        vacant magic item slots, there is a chance of those slots filling with
        new items.</p><h1>Step 4 - Modify Unrest</h1><p>Unrest increases by 1
        for each kingdom attribute (Economy, Loyalty, or Stability) that is a
        negative number.</p><p>The Royal Enforcer may attempt to reduce Unrest
        during this step.</p><p>If the kingdom's Unrest is 11 or higher, it
        loses 1 hex (the leaders choose which hex). See Losing Hexes for more
        information.</p><p>If your kingdom's Unrest ever reaches 20, the kingdom
        falls into anarchy. While in anarchy, your kingdom can take no action
        and treats all Economy, Loyalty, and Stability check results as 0.
        Restoring order once a kingdom falls into anarchy typically requires a
        number of quests and lengthy adventures by you and the other would-be
        leaders to restore the people's faith in
        you.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: Jessica is the Ruler of a kingdom
        with a Size of 30 and a Control DC of 60. Based on leadership role
        bonuses, kingdom alignment bonuses, and buildings in her settlements,
        the kingdom's Economy is 52, its Loyalty is 45, and its Stability is 56.
        Its Unrest is currently 5, its Consumption is 5, and the Treasury has 12
        BP.</p><p>In Step 1 of the Upkeep phase, Adam, the Warden, attempts a
        Stability check to determine the kingdom's stability. Adam rolls a 19,
        adds the kingdom's Stability (56), and subtracts its Unrest (5), for a
        total of 70; that's a success, so Unrest decreases by 1.</p><p>In Step
        2, the kingdom pays 5 BP for Consumption.</p><p>None of the kingdom's
        magic item slots are empty, so they skip Step 3.</p><p>In Step 4, none
        of the attributes are negative, so Unrest doesn't increase. Mark, the
        Royal Enforcer, doesn't want to risk reducing the kingdom's Loyalty, so
        he doesn't use his leadership role to reduce Unrest.</p><p>At the end of
        this phase, the kingdom has Economy 52, Loyalty 45, Stability 56, Unrest
        4, Consumption 5, and Treasury 7 BP.</p><h1>Losing Hexes</h1><p>If you
        lose control of a hex - whether because of Unrest, monster attacks,
        assaults from a hostile kingdom, and so on - you lose all the benefits
        of any terrain improvements in that hex (such as Farms and
        Roads).</p><p>All settlements in that hex become free cities with no
        loyalty to you or any other kingdom (see Free City). At the GM's
        discretion, monsters may move into the abandoned hex, requiring you to
        clear it again if you want to claim it later, and terrain improvements
        may decay over time.</p><p>Losing a hex may break your connection to
        other kingdom hexes. For example, losing the only hex that bridges two
        sides of a mountain range creates two separate territories. If this
        happens, the primary territory is the part of the kingdom with your
        capital city, and the rest of the kingdom is the secondary
        territory.</p><p>If none of the kingdom's leaders are in the secondary
        territory when this split happens, you lose control of all hexes (as
        described above) in the secondary territory.</p><p>If at least one
        kingdom leader is in the secondary territory when the split occurs, you
        retain control of the secondary territory, but kingdom checks regarding
        its hexes treat Unrest as 1 higher, increasing by 1 each turn after the
        split. This modifier goes away if you claim a hex that reconnects the
        secondary territory to the primary territory.</p><p>If you claim a hex
        that reestablishes a connection to a leaderless secondary territory, you
        regain the benefits of the territory's terrain improvements. You must
        succeed at a Stability check to reclaim each of your former settlements
        in the secondary territory. You initially have a +5 bonus on these
        checks because the cities want to return to your kingdom, but this bonus
        decreases by 1 (to a minimum bonus of +0) for each subsequent turn since
        you lost control of the secondary territory.</p><p>If your kingdom is
        reduced to 0 hexes - whether through Unrest, a natural disaster, an
        attack by another kingdom, or other circumstances - you are at risk of
        losing the kingdom. On your next turn, you must claim a new hex and
        found or claim a new settlement, or your kingdom is destroyed and you
        must start over if you want to found a new kingdom. At the GM's
        discretion, you may be able to keep some BP from your destroyed
        kingdom's Treasury for a time; otherwise, those assets are lost.</p>

        <p>The Edict phase is when you make proclamations on expansion,
        improvements, taxation, holidays, and so on.</p><p>The number of

        Instead of creating a new settlement, your kingdom may create a new army
        unit (see Mass Combat), expand or equip an existing army unit, or bring
        an existing army unit back to full strength.</p><p><sup>2</sup>
        Upgrading a building (for example, from a Shrine to a Temple) or
        destroying a building counts toward this limit. The first House,
        Mansion, Noble Villa, or Tenement your kingdom builds each turn does not
        count against this number.</p><h1>Capital City</h1><p>A kingdom should
        have a capital cityâ€”the seat of your power. Your first settlement is
        your capital. If you want to designate a different settlement as the
        capital, you may do so in Step 6 of the Edict phase. Your capital city
        primarily comes into play if your kingdom loses hexes. If you change the
        capital city, attempt a Stability check. Success means Unrest increases
        by 1; failure means Unrest increases by 1d6.</p><h1>Step 1 - Assign
        Leadership</h1><p>Assign PCs or NPCs to any vacant leadership roles or
        change the roles being filled by particular PCs or closely allied
        NPCs.</p><h1>Step 2 - Claim And Abandon Hexes</h1><p>For your kingdom to
        grow, you must claim additional hexes. You can only claim a hex that is
        adjacent to at least 1 other hex in your kingdom. Before you can claim
        it, the hex must first be explored, then cleared of monsters and
        dangerous hazards. Then, to claim the hex, spend 1 BP; this establishes
        the hex as part of your kingdom and increases your kingdom's Size by 1
        (see Steps 2 and 3 of Founding a Settlement for more details). Table:
        Improvement Edicts (see above) tells you the maximum number of hexes you
        can claim per turn.</p><p>You may abandon any number of hexes to reduce
        your kingdom's Size (which you may wish to do to manage Consumption).
        Doing so increases Unrest by 1 for each hex abandoned (or by 4 if the
        hex contained a settlement). This otherwise functions like losing a hex
        due to unrest (see Step 4 of the Upkeep phase).</p><h1>Step 3 - Build
        Terrain Improvements</h1><p>You may spend BP to build terrain
        improvements like Farms, Forts, Roads, Mines, and Quarries (see Terrain
        Improvements below).</p><p>You may also prepare a hex for constructing a
        settlement. Depending on the site, this may involve clearing trees,
        moving boulders, digging sanitation trenches, and so on. See the
        Preparation Cost column on Table: Terrain and Terrain Improvements to
        determine how many BP this requires.</p><p>Table: Improvement Edicts
        (see above) tells you the maximum number of terrain improvements you can
        make per turn</p><h1>Step 4 - Create and Improve Settlements</h1><p>You
        may create a settlement in a claimed hex (see Founding a Settlement).
        Table: Improvement Edicts (above) tells you the maximum number of
        settlements you can establish per turn.</p><p>You may construct a
        building in any settlement in your kingdom. When a building is
        completed, apply its modifiers to your kingdom sheet. Table: Improvement
        Edicts (above) tells you the maximum number of buildings you can
        construct in your kingdom per turn.</p><p>The first House, Mansion,
        Noble Villa, or Tenement your kingdom builds each turn does not count
        against that limit.</p><h1>Step 5: Create Army Units</h1><p>You may
        create, expand, equip, or repair army units (see <a
        href="http://localhost:30000/%22https://aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?Name=Mass%20Combat%20Overview&amp;Category=Mass%20Combat\%22">Mass
        Combat</a>).</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Added here as a placeholder
        for if it is used in a later update. Ignore for right now.</p><h1>Step
        6: Issue Edicts</h1><p>Select or adjust your edict
        levels.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>Jessica's kingdom has no vacant
        leadership roles, so nothing happens in Step 1.</p><p>The leaders don't
        want to spend BP and increase Size right now, so in Step 2 they don't
        claim any hexes.</p><p>In Step 3, the leaders construct a Farm in one of
        the kingdom's prepared hexes (Consumption -2, Treasury -2 BP).</p><p>In
        Steps 4 and 5, the leaders continue to be frugal and do not construct
        settlement improvements or create armies.</p><p>In Step 6, the leaders
        issue a Holiday edict of one national holiday (Loyalty +1, Consumption
        +1) and set the Promotion edict level to "none" (Stability -1,
        Consumption +0).</p><p>Looking ahead to the Income phase, Jessica
        realizes that an average roll for her Economy check would be a failure
        (10 on the 1d20 + 52 Economy - 4 Unrest = 58, less than the Control DC
        of 60), which means there's a good chance the kingdom won't generate any
        BP this turn. She decides to set the Taxation edict to "heavy" (Economy
        +3, Loyalty -4). At the end of this phase, the kingdom has Economy 55,
        Loyalty 42, Stability 55, Unrest 4, Consumption 4, and Treasury 5
        BP</p><h1>Terrain Improvements</h1><p>Terrain improvements are changes
        to a hex that improve the land for your kingdom's use, such as
        cultivating fields, digging mines, and clearing forests for lumber. The
        following list describes common improvements. An improvement marked with
        an asterisk (*) can share the same hex as other improvements.</p><p>Some
        terrain improvements affect a settlement's Defense, which is used in the
        mass combat rules.</p><p><strong>Terrain</strong>: This indicates what
        kind of hex you can build this terrain improvement
        in.</p><p><strong>Effect</strong>: This line states the effect the
        terrain improvement has on that hex (or in some cases, your entire
        kingdom).</p><p>If an improvement says you can upgrade it into another
        improvement, you can do so by paying the cost difference between the two
        improvements. When the upgrade is complete, you lose the benefit of the
        old improvement but gain the benefit of the new
        improvement.</p><p><strong>Cost</strong>: This line gives the cost in BP
        to build the terrain improvement.</p><h2>Terrain and Terrain

        Exploration time represents how many days a typical scouting party
        requires to explore a hex of this type. These times assume a party speed
        of 30 feet. For parties with different speeds, see Table 3-3:
        Exploration Time (1 Hex) on page 154. Treat Cavern as Mountain and
        Jungle as Marsh for exploration time. Do not adjust the speed for Water
        hexes; it's assumed that the party is already using a boat or other
        watercraft to explore.</p><p>2 Preparation time represents the months of
        labor (beginning with the current turn) required to prepare the hex for
        settlement. Construction of buildings can begin in the current month for
        settlements built on plains.</p><p>3 Preparation cost represents the BP
        cost to clear a hex of this type in preparation for founding a
        settlement.</p><p>4 Farm cost represents the BP cost to cultivate a hex
        for farming. A Farm must be within or adjacent to a hex containing a
        river, lake, swamp, or Canal, or adjacent to at least 2 hexes that
        already contain Farms.</p><p>5 Road cost represents the BP cost to
        establish a Road that crosses a hex and connects to all adjacent hexes.
        The cost to build a Road doubles if the hex contains rivers. A kingdom
        with a Size of 26 or greater can build a Highway (or upgrade a Road to a
        Highway).</p><p>6 If the hex contains any rivers, double the listed cost
        to reflect the need to build bridges.</p><p>7 This is a large system of
        caves and underground passages and can be found in any terrain type
        except Marsh. It functions as an additional hex that exists underground,
        below the surface hex.</p><p>8 Treat this as the adjacent land terrain
        type for all purposes.</p><h1>Edicts</h1><p>Edicts are the official
        pronouncements by your government about how you are running the kingdom
        that turn. For example, you may decide to have low or high taxes, to
        have more or fewer holidays, and how much effort to put into improving
        the kingdom's infrastructure. Edicts fall into four types: Holiday,
        Improvement, Promotion, and Taxation.</p><p>In the Edict phase of the
        kingdom turn, you may set the Holiday, Promotion, and Taxation edict
        categories to whatever level you want, as well as decide how much of
        your allowed improvement from the Improvement edict you'll use. For
        example, you may decide that this turn holidays are quarterly,
        promotions are aggressive, taxation is minimal, and you won't build any
        improvements.</p><h2>Improvement Edicts</h2><p>Improvements are physical
        improvements you can make to your kingdom: founding new settlements,
        adding buildings to a settlement, building roads, creating facilities
        such as mines to tap natural resources, and claiming more hexes for your
        kingdom. Your kingdom's Size limits how many improvements you can make
        each turn; see Table: Improvement Edicts. You can make all of the
        improvements listed on the appropriate row of the table. For example, if
        your kingdom's Size is 5, on each turn you can create 1 new settlement,
        1 new building, 2 terrain improvements, and claim 1 more
        hex.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Improvement Edicts are detailed in
        greater depth in Steps 2, 3 and 4 of the Edict Phase.</p><h2>Holiday
        Edicts</h2><p>Holidays are general celebrations or observances that take
        place across the kingdom. The BP expenditure includes lost revenue from
        citizens not working during the holidays, preparations and logistical
        arrangements that occur year round, and the cost of the actual
        celebrations (these annual costs are averaged over the year and included
        in the listed Consumption modifier that you pay each turn).</p><p>The
        number of holidays per year is the number you promise to uphold and the
        number that the common folk expect to enjoy over the next months. The
        Loyalty and Consumption modifiers change as soon as you change the
        number of holidays per year. The listed number assumes that you are
        fulfilling your promise - if you announce 12 holidays in the coming year
        but don't actually hold and pay for them, the GM should increase your
        kingdom's Unrest to reflect public disappointment and
        outrage.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>Logan is the Ruler of a kingdom
        with some Loyalty issues. He issues a Holiday edict that there will be
        24 kingdom-wide official holidays in the next year (Loyalty +4,
        Consumption +8). In the second turn, he worries about the increased
        Consumption's effect on the Treasury, so he issues a new Holiday edict
        decreeing that until further notice, there will be no kingdom-wide
        holidays. He loses the previous +4 Loyalty bonus and incurs a -1 Loyalty
        penalty for the new Holiday edict, but no longer has to pay the 8
        Consumption each turn for his previous edict. If he frequently changes
        Holiday edicts from high to low levels, the GM may decide that his
        citizens no longer believe such promises and he won't gain any benefits
        from having a high level of Holiday edict until he becomes
        consistent.</p><h2>Promotion Edicts</h2><p>Promotion edicts are events
        and actions the kingdom uses to attract new citizens and increase the
        well-being of the kingdom, such as recruitment campaigns, advertisements
        about services and goods, and propaganda to improve the perception of
        your kingdom at home and abroad. Promotions increase Consumption, but
        also increase Stability.</p><h2>Taxation Edicts</h2><p>Setting the tax
        level determines how much revenue you collect from taxes in the Income
        phase. Higher taxes increase your kingdom's Economy (making it easier
        for you to succeed at Economy checks to generate revenue) but make your
        citizens unhappy (reducing Loyalty).</p><h2>Table: Holiday

        <p>During the Income phase, you may add to or withdraw from the Treasury
        as well as collect taxes.</p><h1>Step 1 - Make Withdrawals from the
        treasury</h1><p>The kingdom-building rules allow you to expend BP on
        things related to running the kingdom. If you want to spend some of the
        kingdom's resources on something for your own personal benefit (such as
        a new magic item), you may withdraw BP from the Treasury and convert it
        into gp once per turn, but there is a penalty for doing so.</p><p>Each
        time you withdraw BP for your personal use, Unrest increases by the
        number of BP withdrawn. Each BP you withdraw this way converts to 2,000
        gp of personal funds</p><h1>Step 2 - Make deposits to the
        treasury</h1><p>You can add funds to a kingdom's Treasury by donating
        your personal wealth to the kingdom - coins, gems, jewelry, weapons,
        armor, magic items, and other valuables you find while adventuring, as
        long as they are individually worth 4,000 gp or less. For every full
        4,000 gp in value of the deposit, increase your kingdom's BP by
        1.</p><p>If you want to donate an item that is worth more than 4,000 gp,
        refer to Step 3 instead</p><h1>Step 3 - Sell expensive items for
        bp</h1><p>You can attempt to sell expensive personal items (that is,
        items worth more than 4,000 gp each) through your kingdom's markets to
        add to your Treasury. You may sell one item per settlement district per
        turn. You must choose the settlement where you want to sell the item,
        and the item cannot be worth more than the base value of that
        settlement.</p><p>To sell an item, divide its price by half (as if
        selling it to an NPC for gp), divide the result by 4,000 (rounded down),
        and add that many BP to your Treasury.</p><p>You cannot use this step to
        sell magic items held or created by buildings in your settlements; those
        items are the property of the owners of those businesses. (See Magic
        Items in Settlements for more information on this topic.)</p><h1>Step 4
        - Collect Taxes</h1><p>Attempt an Economy check. If you succeed, divide
        the result by 3 (round down), and add a number of BP to your Treasury
        equal to the result.</p><p><strong>Example: </strong>Jessica and the
        other leaders need to keep BP in the kingdom for future plans, so they
        skip Step 1 of the Income phase.</p><p>They are worried that they won't
        collect enough taxes this turn, so just in case, in Step 2 they deposit
        8,000 gp worth of coins, gems, and small magic items (Treasury +2
        BP).</p><p>The leaders aren't selling any expensive items, so nothing
        happens in Step 3.</p><p>In Step 4, Rob, the Treasurer, rolls the
        Economy check to collect taxes. Rob rolls a 9 on the 1d20, adds the
        kingdom's Economy score (55), and subtracts Unrest (4) for a total of
        60, which means the kingdom adds 20 BP (the Economy check result of 60,
        divided by 3) to the Treasury. At the end of this phase, the kingdom has
        Economy 55, Loyalty 42, Stability 55, Unrest 4, Consumption 4, and
        Treasury 27 BP.</p>

        <p>In the Event phase, a random event may affect your kingdom as a whole
        or a single settlement or hex.</p><p>There is a 25% chance of an event
        occurring. If no event occurred during the last turn, this chance
        increases to 75%.</p><p>Some events can be negated, ended, or
        compensated for with some kind of kingdom check. Others, such as a
        rampaging monster, require you to complete an adventure or deal with a
        problem in a way not covered by the kingdom-building
        rules.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: The GM rolls on one of the event
        tables and determines that a monster is attacking one of the kingdom's
        hexes. Instead of attempting a Stability check to deal with the monster
        (risking increasing Unrest if it fails), Jessica and the other leaders
        go on a quest to deal with the monster personally. They defeat the
        monster, so the event does not generate any Unrest. At the end of this
        phase, the kingdom's scores are unchanged: Economy 55, Loyalty 42,
        Stability 55, Unrest 4, Consumption 4, and Treasury 27
        BP.</p><h1>Kingdom Events</h1><p>Listed below are unusual events that
        can happen during a kingdom's Event phase. Most events occur immediately
        and are instantaneous or terminate at the end of the Event
        phase.</p><p>Some events impact the whole kingdom, while others are
        centered on a specific settlement or hex. Roll on Table: Event Type and
        Danger Level to determine the type of event and whether it is beneficial
        or harmful. Then roll on the appropriate beneficial or dangerous
        settlement or kingdom event table. If this results in an invalid event
        (such as a pilgrimage when there are no Cathedrals, Shrines, or Temples
        in the kingdom), roll again.</p><p><strong>Continuous Events</strong>: A
        continuous event's effects continue each turn during the Event phase
        until you resolve the event (as explained in the event description,
        usually by succeeding at a kingdom check).</p><p><strong>Localized
        Events</strong>: Some events are listed as "settlement" or "hex." The
        effect of these events are localized to a single settlement or hex.
        Randomly select a settlement or hex for the location of that event. Some
        events (such as a feud) could be confined to a settlement or start in
        one settlement and spread to affect the entire kingdom, depending on
        whether they're rolled on one of the Kingdom Events tables or one of the
        Settlement Events tables.</p><p><strong>Settlement Modifiers</strong>:
        Some events adjust settlement modifiers (Crime, Lore, etc.). If an event
        is localized to 1 settlement, its settlement modifier adjustments apply
        only to that settlement; if it's localized to a hex, it affects only
        settlements in that hex. If the GM is using settlement modifiers for the
        entire kingdom (see Expanding Settlement Modifiers on page 230) and the
        event is not localized, its adjustments apply to the final modifier for
        the entire kingdom. For example, the new subjects event increases
        Society and Stability for the entire kingdom by
        1.</p><p><strong>Table:</strong>
