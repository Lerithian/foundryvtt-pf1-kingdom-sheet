      <p>Your army tries to escape from all armies attacking it. The army
      attempts an opposed Morale check against each army attacking it to
      maintain discipline (any army may voluntarily fail this check), but
      doesn’t need to attempt the usual Morale check to change tactics when
      switching to withdraw. If all of these checks are successful, your army
      may withdraw from the battlefield or treat the phase as a Ranged phase. If
      only some are successful, you may withdraw or treat the phase as a Ranged
      phase, but enemy armies in the battle may attack you as if you were in
      Melee. Whether or not the checks are successful, reduce your army’s OM and
      DV by 2 for the rest of this phase.</p>
