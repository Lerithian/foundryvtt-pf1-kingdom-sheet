      <p>Once per battle, your army can make a false retreat, luring a target
      enemy army deeper into your territory. On the phase your army makes a
      false retreat, it doesnâ€™t attempt an Offense check. On the phase after it
      uses this tactic, increase its OM and DV by 6 against the target army.</p>
