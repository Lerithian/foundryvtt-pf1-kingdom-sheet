      <p>Your army is skilled at taunting its opponents, provoking stupid
      mistakes and overconfidence in battle. The target army must attempt a
      Morale check (DC = 10 + your army’s ACR) at the start of each Melee or
      Ranged phase; failure means it reduces its OM and DV against your army by
      2 for that phase. If the target army succeeds at two of these Morale
      checks, it’s immune to this tactic for the remainder of the battle.</p>
