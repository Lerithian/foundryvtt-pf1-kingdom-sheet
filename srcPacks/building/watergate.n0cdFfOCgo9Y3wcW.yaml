      <p>A gate in a City Wall that allows water (such as a river, Aqueduct, or
      Waterway) to enter the settlement. A Watergate has underwater defenses to
      block unwanted access. If you construct a Watergate when you construct a
      City Wall, the Watergate does not count toward the limit of the number of
      buildings you can construct per turn.</p><hr /><p><strong>Special</strong>
