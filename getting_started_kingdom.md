# Summary Tab

The kingdom's size is the sum of the hex types in the terrain tab.

# Leadership Tab

The ruler and spymaster can choose what kingdom stat(s) their bonus will affect with the drop down in each of their rows.

Viceroys can be added with the add viceroy button (+ icon) in the top right corner of the tab.

# Settlements Tab

Settlements can be added with the create settlement button on the secondary nav bar (+ icon).

If a building is dragged onto an active settlement, it will be auto assigned to that settlement. Otherwise, buildings dropped onto the kingdom sheet will appear in the buildings without settlements tab (house icon), which is where buildings not associated with a settlement are found. These buildings do not affect the kingdom's stats until they are assigned a settlement in the building sheet's details tab.

If a building that provides a magic item slot is destroyed/damaged the slots will remain on the page with a warning that there are more items than slots. Manually deleting slots can be done by clicking the trash can icon on the slot.

# Terrain Tab

The "Hex Types" section shows the types of hexes the kingdom has claimed. The sum of these fields is your kingdom's size.

# Events Tab

The roll event button will roll the event chance, then roll on the event table to determine the event (if one takes place).

# Armies Tab

Dragging an army actor onto the kingdom sheet will create a link to the army accessible in this tab.

The create army button (+ icon) will create a new army actor in the world and create a link to it.

The delete army button (trash can icon) will only delete the link to the army. The army actor will remain in the world.

# Notes Tab

Pretty self explanatory. 

# Settings Tab

Checking the second ruler checkbox will change the consort role to act as a second ruler.
