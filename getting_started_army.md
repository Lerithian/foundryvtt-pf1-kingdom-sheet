# Summary Tab

Size and ACR are undefined in a newly created army, but are required to be filled in for the sheet to work correctly.

# Features Tab

Only one tactic can be active at one time.

# Commander Tab

The kingdom leader checkbox signifies that the commander has a role in a kingdom. They can use their HD rather than ranks in profession soldier to determine their morale bonus and max boons.

By rule, boons are linked to a commander, not an army. A limitation of this sheet is that if the commander changes, the boons will remain. So manual changes will be required. Likewise, kingdom leaders get a free default boon, which is not applied automatically.

# Conditions Tab

There are links to the compendium holding rules for the battlefield conditions. Most bonuses/penalties are applied automatically, but not all.

# Notes Tab

Pretty self explanatory.
